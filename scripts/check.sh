# Source hygiene
# kprint/kprintln take (string, length) and the compiler does NOT verify the two agree — short truncates the
# line, long runs past the literal. The build stays green either way, so this only ever surfaced by eye, and
# an off-by-one in a burn's PASS line is indistinguishable from a failed burn when you are reading a console
# photo. Wired in 2026-07-19 after a single A4 instrumentation bite introduced four of them (every one of the
# other 913 literals in gpu.cyr + main.cyr was correct). Failures print in full — a bare FAIL line would not
# be actionable.

# Binary size sanity. The 350KB bound dated to the v1.22.0 / ~250KB era and
# went stale across the storage (1.31.x), networking (1.32.x), ext2/4-write
# (1.33.x), FAT-family (1.34.x), and DNS (1.35.x) arcs — the kernel is ~806KB.
# Ceiling moved to 1.2M, then 1.4M: the 1.44.x scheduler + 1.45.x net arcs closed
# on 1.2M and the 1.46.x lseek/flock syscalls crossed it (~1,203,984 B), so the
# bound moved 1.2M → 1.4M. The 1.54.x GPU arc (F0 landed ~1.40M; C0+ add the
# CP/MEC/RLC/PSP register tables) moved it 1.4M → 1.5M — still catching a
# runaway-bloat regression. The 1.55.x DISPLAY arc's display-audio bite then closed
# on 1.5M (1,560,016 B — 16 B over, the same way 1.45.10 closed on 1.2M), so the
# bound moved 1.5M → 1.6M; that arc's growth is the OTG-timing and HDMI/AFMT/ACR
# register tables, not bloat. Matches scripts/test.sh (bumped in lockstep).
# The 1.55.x SHUTDOWN arc then closed on 1.6M (1,600,712 B — 712 B over, the
# same way 1.45.10 closed on 1.2M and the display-audio bite closed on 1.5M),
# so the bound moved 1.6M -> 1.7M. That arc's growth is the ACPI FADT/_S5
# decode plus the per-subsystem quiesce paths, not bloat.
