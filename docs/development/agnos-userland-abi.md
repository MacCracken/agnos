## 0. Decisions (settled 2026-05-31, agnos-side)

These were open questions; they're now decided so the cyrius peer has a real target. Recorded here, applied
throughout the doc below.

| # | Decision | Rationale |
|---|----------|-----------|
| **O2** | **`a4 = r10`** — the syscall ABI grows from 3 args to 4; the 4th is in `r10`. | `rename(old,oldlen,new,newlen)` is inherently 4-arg. `r10` is the natural 4th-arg register (SYSCALL clobbers `rcx`, which is exactly why Linux picked `r10` — we adopt the *register*, not their numbers). Additive; entry stub saves `r10`, `syscall_handler`/`ksyscall` gain `a4`. Lands with 1.41.3. |
| **O1** | **stdin = canonical-lite** — `read(fd=0)` blocks until Enter, **echoes** printable bytes + handles backspace, returns the line incl. its trailing `\n`. *(Revised 1.41.15; originally RAW + no-echo.)* | RAW was settled assuming the QEMU `hid_poll` model (polled, IF-independent). On **iron** keystrokes arrive only via IRQ1 and ring 3 runs **IF=0 between syscalls** (`ring3.cyr` sets RFLAGS=0x002), so RAW byte-by-byte is *structurally impossible* — any scancode arriving while `agnsh` is in userland is lost (the `14114` "Command: D" stuck-shift collapse). A continuous-IF whole-line read is the only shape that types on iron, and once the read is line-buffered echo must be kernel-side (the shell can't see chars until the line completes) — so the kernel mirrors the proven in-kernel recovery shell's echo loop. A richer `agnsh` line editor (`completion.cyr`) that needs raw keystrokes returns when the future multithreading arc lets ring 3 run IF=1 + safe preemption; O1 reverts to RAW then. Observable syscall numbers unchanged → no cyrius peer change. |
| **O3** | **`open(AO_DIRECTORY)` returns a normal fd** that `getdents` (29) consumes. | Reuse the `vfs_table` slot model + a dir tag — matches the existing fd plumbing; no separate dir-handle type. |
| **O4** | **FAT/exFAT `stat`/`link` degrade gracefully.** `stat` fills `st_ino=0` + size/type from the dirent; `link` is ext2-only (returns -1 on FAT). | Inherent — FAT has no inodes or hard links. `ls -l` on FAT shows size/type, ino 0. |

## 1. Calling convention (x86-64)

From `kernel/arch/x86_64/syscall_hw.cyr`:

| Register | Role |
|----------|------|
| `rax` | syscall number (in) / return value (out) |
| `rdi` | arg1 (a1) |
| `rsi` | arg2 (a2) |
| `rdx` | arg3 (a3) |
| `rcx` | **clobbered** by `SYSCALL` (holds return RIP) — do not pass args here |
| `r11` | **clobbered** by `SYSCALL` (holds return RFLAGS) |

- **Instruction**: `syscall` (AMD64 SYSCALL/SYSRET). Entry stub at `LSTAR`; `STAR` sets kernel CS `0x08`,
  user CS base `0x10` (SYSRET returns CS `0x20|3`, SS `0x18|3`). `SFMASK` masks IF → **interrupts are off
  inside the kernel during a syscall** (a blocking syscall that must wait re-enables them itself — see §5 stdin).
- **Arg count is 3 today** (`a1`/`a2`/`a3` = `rdi`/`rsi`/`rdx`). The kernel dispatcher is
  `ksyscall(num, a1, a2, a3)`.
- **Return convention**: `rax` ≥ 0 on success (fd / byte count / pid / value), **`-1` (`0 - 1`) on error**.
  AGNOS does **not** use Linux `-errno`. Some void-success calls return `0`. (A richer error channel is a
  future option; today it's `-1`.)
- **Unknown syscall number → `-1`.**
- **User-pointer rule**: every userspace buffer pointer must be **≥ `0x200000`** (the kernel reserves
  `0–2 MB`). The kernel validates with `is_user_ptr(p)` (`p ≥ 0x200000`) and `is_user_range(p, len)`
  (`p ≥ 0x200000` ∧ no `p+len` overflow). A pointer below `0x200000` → the call returns `-1`.
- **Process exit epilogue**: a static binary's `main()` returns into a `syscall(0, exit_code)` (agnos `exit`).
  Note this is **agnos exit = 0**, *not* Linux `exit_group`/`60` — the Cyrius `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS` runtime
  `_start`/`exit` shim must use agnos numbers, not the Linux `syscall(60, …)` epilogue.

### 1a. ✅ DECIDED (O2) — 4th argument (`a4` = `r10`)

`rename(old, oldlen, new, newlen)` needs **four** arguments, which the original 3-arg ABI couldn't carry.
**Decision: `a4 = r10`** — `r10` is the natural 4th-arg register (SYSCALL clobbers `rcx`, which is exactly why
Linux uses `r10`; agnos adopts the *register*, not Linux's numbers). Additive kernel change (the entry stub
saves `r10`, `syscall_handler`/`ksyscall` gain `a4`); lands with 1.41.3. Rejected alternatives: NUL-terminated
names (breaks the explicit-length invariant every agnos syscall holds); a packed args-struct pointer (extra
indirection for one call). **The cyrius peer's agnos syscall wrappers pass the 4th arg in `r10`.**

## 2. 🔒 FROZEN syscall table (0–28, live today)

`a1/a2/a3` columns give the argument meaning; `→` is the return. "shell" marks calls the userland `agnsh`
will use; "🩺" marks kernel-diagnostic-only.

| # | Name | a1 | a2 | a3 | → | Notes |
|---|------|----|----|----|---|-------|
| 0 | `exit` | code | — | — | (no return) | sets exit code, resumes kernel via `kernel_resume`. **shell** |
| 1 | `write` | fd | buf | len | bytes / -1 | `vfs_write`; fd 1/2 → console. **shell** |
| 2 | `getpid` | — | — | — | pid | returns `proc_current`. **shell** |
| 3 | `spawn` | elf_addr | elf_size | — | pid / -1 | loads an **in-memory** ELF (not a path). See §5 exec note. |
| 4 | `waitpid` | pid | — | — | exit_code / -1 | busy-waits until `state==0`. **shell** |
| 5 | `read` | fd | buf | len | bytes / -1 | `vfs_read`. **fd 0 = stdin** — see §5 (currently → serial; 1.41.1 makes it the keyboard). **shell** |
| 6 | `close` | fd | — | — | 0 / -1 | `vfs_close`. **shell** |
| 7 | `open` | name | namelen | — | fd / -1 | **currently `initrd_open` ONLY** (can't reach the agnos-fs). 1.41.3 re-routes — see §5. **shell** |
| 8 | `dup` | fd | — | — | fd | 🔧 stub: returns `a1` unchanged. |
| 9 | `mkdir` | path | pathlen | — | 0 | 🔧 stub → 0. 1.41.3 makes it real. **shell** |
| 10 | `rmdir` | path | pathlen | — | 0 | 🔧 stub → 0. 1.41.3 makes it real. **shell** |
| 11 | `mount` | — | — | — | 0 | 🔧 stub (no-op). |
| 12 | `sync` | — | — | — | 0 | 🔧 stub → 0. 1.41.3 wires to `vfs_sync`. **shell** |
| 13 | `reboot` | — | — | — | (halts) | `serial_println` + `arch_halt`. **shell** (`halt`) |
| 14 | `pause` | — | — | — | 0 | `arch_wait` (one hlt). |
| 15 | `getuid` | — | — | — | 0 | 🔧 stub (always root=0). |
| 16 | `kill` | pid | sig | — | 0 / -1 | `proc_send_signal`; pid 0 protected, self/child only. |
| 17 | `sigprocmask` | how | set_ptr | oldset_ptr | 0 / -1 | how: 0=BLOCK, 1=UNBLOCK. ptrs ≥ 0x200000. |
| 18 | `signalfd` | fd | mask_ptr | flags | fd / -1 | allocates a `VFS_SIGNALFD`. |
| 19 | `epoll_create` | — | — | — | fd / -1 | allocates a `VFS_EPOLL` (8-watch list). |
| 20 | `epoll_ctl` | epfd | op | fd | 0 / -1 | op: 1=ADD, 2=clear. max 8 watches. |
| 21 | `epoll_wait` | epfd | events_ptr | max | nready | event rec = `{u32 mask; u64 data}` @ 12 B stride; `max`≤16; hlt if none ready. |
| 22 | `timerfd_create` | — | — | — | fd / -1 | allocates a `VFS_TIMERFD`. |
| 23 | `timerfd_settime` | fd | flags | val_ptr | 0 / -1 | `val_ptr`→`{u64 interval_sec; _; u64 initial_sec}` (24 B); ticks = sec×100. |
| 24 | `umount` | — | — | — | 0 | 🔧 stub → 0. |
| 25 | `pipe` | fds_ptr | — | — | 0 / -1 | writes 2× u64 fds at `fds_ptr` (16 B, ≥0x200000). `vfs_create_pipe`. |
| 26 | `write_boot_checkpoint` | byte | — | — | 0 | 🩺 writes `CMOS[0x50]=byte&0xFF` (iron-boot progress marker). |
| 27 | `mmap` | length | — | — | base_vaddr / 0 | anonymous, zero-filled, **2 MB-granular**; `0` = MAP_FAILED. |
| 28 | `munmap` | addr | length | — | 0 / -1 | frees an mmap region (2 MB-granular, LIFO vaddr reclaim). |

**Notes for the cyrius peer**: `epoll`/`signalfd`/`timerfd`/`sigprocmask`/`pipe` pass small fixed-layout
structs through user pointers — mirror the exact byte offsets above (they're agnos-native, **not** the Linux
`struct epoll_event`/`itimerspec` layouts). `dup`/`getuid`/`mount`/`umount` are stubs — the peer may expose
them but must not rely on real behavior.

## 3. ✅ DECIDED — 1.41.x additions + changes (not yet implemented; the shell-separation surface)

These are the agnos-side bites (1.41.1 stdin, 1.41.3 FS). The spec is **decided** (§0 settled O1–O4) and
mirror-able; both agents code to it, and each row **moves to 🔒 FROZEN (update §2) as the kernel lands it**.

### 3.1 Changed behavior (same numbers)

- **🔒 `read`(5) on `fd 0` → blocking keyboard stdin** (**IMPLEMENTED 1.41.1**; **IRQ1 mechanism corrected
  1.41.14**; **line discipline + echo 1.41.15**). When `fd==0`, the kernel blocks until **Enter**, drains the
  whole line under one continuous interrupt-enabled window, and returns the bytes incl. the trailing `\n` (or a
  short line if the caller's `len` fills first). **Line discipline = canonical-lite (O1, revised 1.41.15)** —
  the kernel **echoes** printable bytes via `kputc` (serial + GOP framebuffer), handles **backspace** as
  `BS SP BS`, and terminates on newline; `kb_shift`/`kb_ctrl` are reset on entry. This is the in-kernel recovery
  shell's input loop, lifted into the syscall. **Mechanism**: `sti` for the whole-line read so the **IRQ1
  handler (`kb_isr`) fills `kb_buf`** — the keystroke producer on real hardware. Holding IF=1 across the entire
  line (not per-byte) is the load-bearing change: every make/break is processed in-window, so a shift-release is
  never stranded across the ring-3 IF=0 gap (`ring3.cyr` enters ring 3 with RFLAGS=0x002; SYSRET restores it).
  The 1.41.14 per-byte read returned after the first char, and that IF=0 inter-byte gap dropped shift-release
  breaks → `kb_shift` latched → `d`→`D`, every line collapsing to a single stuck char (the `14114` "Command: D"
  burn). Preemption is suspended (`sched_active=0`) around the window so the timer ISR can't context-switch the
  non-reentrant syscall (it still EOIs + advances `timer_ticks`). `kb_has_key()` additionally drains the xHCI
  HID ring via `hid_poll()` — the QEMU producer. Busy-poll, no `hlt`, so a blocked read spins one core
  (single-foreground model). **NB — observable syscall numbers/arg-passing are unchanged (the *line discipline*
  changed, not the call shape), so the cyrius peer is unaffected.** *(History: the original 1.41.1 spec polled
  `hid_poll()` with IF MASKED — QEMU-only; 1.41.14 fixed that to IRQ1+`sti`; 1.41.15 made it whole-line +
  echoed after the `14114` stuck-shift collapse.)* Other fds keep the `vfs_read` path.
- **`open`(7) → mount-routed** (1.41.3). Re-route from `initrd_open`-only to `vfs_resolve_mount` →
  `ext2_open` (inode-wise) or `vfs_open_on` (FAT/exFAT), with `initrd` as the bare-name fallback. **Gains a
  flags arg** (a3) — see 3.3. Opening a **directory** returns a dir-fd usable by `getdents` (29).
- **`mkdir`(9) / `rmdir`(10) / `sync`(12) → real** (1.41.3): wire to `vfs_mkdir_on`/`vfs_rmdir_on` (mount-routed)
  and `vfs_sync`. Signatures unchanged (`mkdir`/`rmdir` take `path`,`pathlen`; `sync` takes none).

### 3.2 New syscalls (numbers assigned from the next free slots, 29+)

| # | Name | a1 | a2 | a3 | a4 | → | Semantics |
|---|------|----|----|----|----|---|-----------|
| 29 | `getdents` | dir_fd | buf | bufsize | — | bytes / 0 (end) / -1 | fills `buf` with packed dirent records (§4.2) up to `bufsize`; returns bytes written, `0` at end of dir. dir_fd from `open` on a directory. **shell** (`ls`) |
| 30 | `unlink` | path | pathlen | — | — | 0 / -1 | remove a file (mount-routed `vfs_delete_on`/`ext2` unlink). **shell** (`rm`) |
| 31 | `rename` | old | oldlen | new | newlen | 0 / -1 | rename within one filesystem (uses **a4** — §1a). **shell** (`mv`) |
| 32 | `link` | target | targetlen | linkpath | linkpathlen | 0 / -1 | hard link (a4); ext2 only initially. **shell** (`ln`) |
| 33 | `stat` | path | pathlen | statbuf | — | 0 / -1 | fills `statbuf` (§4.1, ≥0x200000) with the agnos stat struct. **shell** (`ls -l`, type) |
| 34 | `uname` | buf | len (≥64) | — | — | 0 / -1 | writes the 64-byte identity struct (§4.3) into `buf`: sysname/nodename/release/machine. Static boot-time identity. **mihi/iam** (1.42.10) |
| 35 | `sysinfo` | buf | len (≥40) | — | — | 0 / -1 | writes the 40-byte counters struct (§4.4) into `buf`: uptime_secs / total+free RAM bytes / procs / cpus. Live snapshot; kernel does the unit conversion. **mihi/iam/chakshu** (1.42.10) |
| 36 | `klog` | buf | len | — | — | bytes / -1 | copies the unified **klug** kernel-log ring (§4.5) into `buf`, oldest→newest; when `len` < the log fill, returns the **newest** `len` bytes (dmesg tail). Returns bytes written. **klug/dmesg tool** (1.42.12) |
| 37 | `execwait` | path | pathlen | env blob (opt, 1.44.19) | env len (a4=r10) | child exit code / -1 | loads a static ELF64 from the ext2 root, runs it to completion **in ring 3**, returns the child's exit code. Synchronous `elf_load_from_file` + `exec_and_wait` (no preemption); the FIRST such exec from a live ring-3 syscall frame, so the handler preserves the caller's resume context (H1) + runs the child on a disjoint second SYSCALL kstack (H2). `execwait` passes only the program path (no caller-supplied argv); the kernel stages a uniform default envp (`HOME=/`, `PWD=/`) on every exec as of **1.43.2** — see §4.6. **agnsh `run`** (1.43.0) |
| 38 | `fbinfo` | buf | len (≥24) | — | — | 0 / -1 | writes the 24-byte framebuffer geometry struct (width / height / pitch / bpp / fmt) into `buf`. The ring-3 query before a `blit`. **cyrius-doom / fbtest** (1.43.4) |
| 39 | `blit` | src | w | h | dstxy `+`scale | 0 / -1 | copies a `w`×`h` block of 32bpp pixels from `src` (packed `w*4`/row) to the framebuffer at (dx,dy); `a4` = `(scale[39:32]<<32)\|(dy[31:16]<<16)\|dx[15:0]`. `scale` 0/1 = 1:1 (byte-identical), ≥2 = integer block scale via a 32 KB src-major rowbuf; dst rect clipped to FB. Memory-safety gate `w*scale ≤ 8192`; `scale > 16` rejects. THE ring-3 FB path (`fb_phys` stays unexposed). **cyrius-doom** (1.43.4; scale 1.44.20) |
| 40 | `uptime_ms` | — | — | — | — | ms | monotonic milliseconds since boot, returned in `rax` (from `timer_ticks` @ 100 Hz). No args, no fault surface. **ring-3 timing / DOOM** (1.43.5) |
| 41 | `sleep_ms` | ms | — | — | — | 0 | block the caller ~`ms` ms by halting until the 100 Hz timer (capped 1 h). An IF-window syscall — `preempt_disable()`-gated (1.44.1) so the shared kstack stays serial under preemption. **ring-3 timing / DOOM** (1.43.5) |
| 42 | `kbscan` | buf | max | — | — | count | NON-BLOCKING raw-scancode drain into `buf` (up to `max`) for ring-3 input (games need key up/down, not cooked lines). Bounded `hid_poll` window; `preempt_disable()`-gated IF-window. **cyrius-doom** (1.43.x) |
| 43 | `spawn_path` | path | pathlen (≤127) | env blob (opt, 1.44.19) | env len (a4=r10) | pid / -1 | NON-BLOCKING from-disk spawn: loads a static ELF64 from the ext2 root (with argv + optional envp) and creates a **READY ring-3 proc the scheduler picks up**, returning its pid IMMEDIATELY — the caller stays live and reaps it via non-blocking `waitpid`(4). spawn(3)'s shape (copy → boot CR3 → `elf_load_from_file` → restore caller CR3) with no blocking machinery. The kernel half of agnsh `&`. **agnsh `&`** (1.44.x) |
| 44 | `sched_yield` | — | — | — | — | 0 | voluntary end-of-slice from ring 3 (abandon-frame): donates the remainder of the timer slice to the next ready proc, returns 0 when re-scheduled. Dispatched only via the ring-3 SYSCALL entry stub (not `ksyscall`); guarded on sched_active/preempt/ew37_busy/IF=0/non-ready-next. agnsh's bg-poll loop yields after unproductive polls. **agnsh `&`** (1.44.16) |

**37 `execwait` is IMPLEMENTED (1.43.0)** — the ring-3 blocking-exec primitive that lets a userland shell launch an on-disk program. It is the syscall behind agnoshi's gated `run` builtin (un-gated at agnoshi 1.4.4 by flipping `RUN_EXECWAIT_READY` + routing `process_agnos.cyr`'s `run()` through `syscall(37, path, len)`). Reuses the proven recovery-shell exec path; the novelty is being invoked from a *live ring-3 syscall frame*, handled by snapshotting the caller's resume-context globals + swapping to a disjoint second syscall kstack (`0x3D0000`) for the nested child. `EXEC_SELFTEST`'s `/bin/exwv` gates the full ring-3-caller path.

**34 `uname` / 35 `sysinfo` are IMPLEMENTED (1.42.10)** — the sovereign sysinfo surface for the native system-info tools. Split (identity vs counters) so a monitor like `chakshu` can poll `sysinfo` repeatedly without re-copying the static strings; each struct is single-shaped (all-string / all-u64) to avoid mixed-width padding. Both reject `is_user_range(buf,N)==0` or `len<N`. Kept *out* of the kernel deliberately: CPU brand string (userland CPUID), GPU manifest (userland PCI), distro (rootfs `/etc/os-release`), load-avg/swap (no native source). Userland calls them via the raw `syscall(34/35, buf, len)` builtin (no cyrius stdlib change required).

`create` is **not** a separate syscall — file creation is `open(7)` with the `AO_CREAT` flag (§3.3),
subsuming `touch` (CREAT) and `echo >` (CREAT|TRUNC). `chdir`/`getcwd` are **not** in the ABI: **CWD is
userland-owned** — `agnsh` tracks its own CWD and passes **absolute paths** to every syscall.

### 3.3 ✅ `open` flags (a3) — agnos-native bits

Access mode in the low 2 bits; modifiers above. **These are AGNOS values, not Linux's** (don't copy
`O_CREAT=0x40` etc. — the peer defines `AO_*` to match this table):

| Flag | Value | Meaning |
|------|-------|---------|
| `AO_RDONLY` | `0x0` | read only (default) |
| `AO_WRONLY` | `0x1` | write only |
| `AO_RDWR` | `0x2` | read+write |
| `AO_CREAT` | `0x100` | create if absent (subsumes `touch`) |
| `AO_TRUNC` | `0x200` | truncate to zero on open (with CREAT = `echo >`) |
| `AO_APPEND` | `0x400` | seek to end on each write |
| `AO_DIRECTORY` | `0x800` | must be a directory (for `getdents`) |

## 4. ✅ Struct layouts (agnos-native — mirror exactly)

### 4.1 `stat` struct (48 bytes, 8-byte fields)

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `st_mode` | u64 | POSIX-style type+perm bits (`0x8000`=file, `0x4000`=dir, `0xA000`=symlink in the top nibble — the kernel already speaks these via `ext2_inode_mode`) |
| 8 | `st_nlink` | u64 | hard-link count |
| 16 | `st_size` | u64 | size in bytes |
| 24 | `st_ino` | u64 | inode number (ext2) / 0 for FAT/exFAT |
| 32 | `st_blocks` | u64 | 512-byte block count |
| 40 | `st_mtime` | u64 | unix mtime (0 if unknown) |

Kept minimal + 8-byte-aligned (no packed sub-word fields → no Cyrius struct-padding ambiguity). Reuses POSIX
`st_mode` top-nibble because the kernel's inode layer already uses it; everything else is agnos's own.

### 4.2 `getdents` record (variable length, reclen-delimited)

Packed records back-to-back in the caller's `buf`; advance by `reclen`:

| Offset | Field | Type | Notes |
|--------|-------|------|-------|
| 0 | `reclen` | u16 | total record length incl. name + padding (next record starts here) |
| 2 | `type` | u8 | 1=file, 2=dir, 3=symlink, 0=unknown |
| 3 | `namelen` | u8 | name byte length (≤255) |
| 4 | `ino` | u32 | inode (ext2) / 0 |
| 8 | `name[namelen]` | bytes | **not** NUL-terminated; `namelen` is authoritative |
| 8+namelen | pad | — | to the next 8-byte boundary; `reclen` accounts for it |

Compact + 8-byte-record-aligned. Agnos-native (not Linux `dirent64`'s `d_off`/19-byte header).

### 4.3 `uname` struct (64 bytes, 4× 16-byte fixed-width NUL-padded string fields)

Written by syscall 34. Each field is a fixed 16-byte slot, the string copied from a kernel literal and NUL-padded to fill the slot (**not** NUL-terminated-and-variable — read by fixed offset):

| Offset | Field | Width | Value |
|--------|-------|-------|-------|
| 0 | `sysname` | 16 | `"AGNOS"` (kernel name) |
| 16 | `nodename` | 16 | hostname — `kernel_hostname`, default `"agnos"` (no `sethostname` yet) |
| 32 | `release` | 16 | kernel version — `_AGNOS_VERSION` (e.g. `"1.42.10"`) |
| 48 | `machine` | 16 | arch — `"x86_64"` (the aarch64 build would emit `"aarch64"`) |

16 bytes/field is generous headroom (longest current value is `"aarch64"`=7); the 64-byte struct is a clean power of two. Conceptually mirrors Linux `utsname` but renumbered to AGNOS slot 34, with our explicit-(buf,len) + fixed-16 layout instead of Linux's 65-byte FQDN-sized fields.

### 4.4 `sysinfo` struct (40 bytes, 5× u64 little-endian)

Written by syscall 35. The kernel does the unit conversion (ticks→seconds at 100 Hz, pages→bytes at 4 KB) so userland never re-derives:

| Offset | Field | Type | Source |
|--------|-------|------|--------|
| 0 | `uptime_secs` | u64 | `timer_ticks / 100` (100 Hz; nominal, not wall-clock-precise) |
| 8 | `totalram` | u64 | `pmm_total * 4096` (bytes; the kernel-managed page pool) |
| 16 | `freeram` | u64 | `pmm_free_count() * 4096` (bytes) |
| 24 | `procs` | u64 | `proc_count` (live process-table count) |
| 32 | `cpus` | u64 | `cpu_count` (=1 until SMP enumeration lands) |

All-u64 (no sub-word fields → no Cyrius struct-padding ambiguity, same rule §4.1 follows). No Linux `mem_unit` scaling field (AGNOS uses fixed u64 byte counts — no 32-bit overflow), no `_f[]` padding, and no swap/buffer/highmem fields (AGNOS has none — omitted). Future fields append at the tail and bump the minimum `len`; the existing offsets are frozen ABI the moment a consumer reads them.

### 4.5 `klog` read (syscall 36 — variable-length log copy, not a struct)

`klog(buf, len)` copies the unified **klug** kernel-log ring (`core/klug.cyr`, a 16 KB circular byte buffer fed by every `kprint`/`kputc`/`kprintln`) into the user `buf`, **oldest→newest** (chronological). It is not a fixed struct — it returns raw log text and the byte count:

- Returns `min(len, ring_fill)` — the number of bytes written — or `-1` if `is_user_range(buf, len)` fails.
- When `len` < the current ring fill, returns the **newest** `len` bytes (the dmesg tail) so a small buffer still shows the most recent lines.
- The ring wraps at 16 KB (old lines age out); the kernel unwraps oldest→newest so the userland reader always sees chronological order regardless of the wrap point.
- Leveled lines carry an `[I]`/`[W]`/`[E]` prefix (from `klog_info`/`klog_warn`/`klog_err`) — the userland `klug`/`dmesg` tool greps on that prefix (the kernel does **no** filtering: it unifies the log; grep stays userland).

### 4.6 exec init stack — argv + envp (1.43.2)

`elf_load_from_file` builds a standard SysV process init stack; `rsp` at entry points at `argc`. cyrius's agnos runtime captures it as `_agnos_init_rsp` (`args_agnos.cyr`). Layout (each slot a u64):

| offset from rsp | contents |
|-----------------|----------|
| `0` | `argc` (≤ 8) |
| `8 + i*8` | `argv[i]` → string VA (i = 0 .. argc-1) |
| `8 + argc*8` | argv NULL terminator |
| `8 + (argc+1+j)*8` | **`envp[j]`** → `"KEY=VALUE"` string VA (j = 0 .. envc-1) |
| `8 + (argc+1+envc)*8` | envp NULL terminator |
| `8 + (argc+2+envc)*8` | auxv `AT_NULL` type (0) |
| `8 + (argc+3+envc)*8` | auxv `AT_NULL` val (0) |

The `KEY=VALUE` and argv strings live higher in the stack page (`0x3100..0x4000`). **envp (1.43.2):** the kernel stages a uniform default — `envp[0]="HOME=/"`, `envp[1]="PWD=/"` — on every exec (was an empty envp NULL pre-1.43.2). **cyrius half:** `getenv()`'s agnos branch reads `envp[j] = load64(_agnos_init_rsp + 8 + (argc+1+j)*8)` and walks `KEY=VALUE` to NULL — the language-work the cyrius agent owns. Per-process env propagation (threading a caller-supplied env through `execwait`) is a kernel follow-on.

**Per-process env wire format (1.44.19, #37 + #43):** `a3` = user pointer to a flat NUL-separated
`KEY=VALUE\0KEY=VALUE\0` blob, `a4` (= r10) = blob byte length. Caps: **<=1024 bytes, 1..16
entries**, every entry `KEY=...` with `=` at index >=1, trailing NUL required. The caller env
**REPLACES** the default (never merges); `a3==0` (or ANY validation failure) falls back to the
uniform default — **fallback-only, never -1**, because legacy 3-arg callers deliver garbage a3/a4
(the cyrius `syscall()` builtin pops exactly N arg registers; old-agnsh-on-new-kernel is the normal
ESP-only deployment). The kernel copies the blob via a fault-proof page-table walk of the caller's
CR3 (garbage pointers are rejected, not dereferenced). The 16-entry cap is load-bearing: the envp
pointer array (`0x3008+(argc+3+envc)*8`) must stay below the 0x3100 string base. Consumers: build
within the caps client-side (an oversized blob silently degrades to the default env).

## 5. Coordination protocol (two-agent)

1. **agnos lands the agnos-side** (1.41.1 stdin → 1.41.3 FS surface), implementing §3 and moving each entry
   to 🔒 in §2 as it ships.
2. **cyrius builds `CYRIUS_TARGET_AGNOS`** (`lib/syscalls_x86_64_agnos.cyr` + the `PP_PREDEFINE` target macro)
   mirroring **this doc** — numbers, the 3→4 arg convention (§1a), the `AO_*` flags (§3.3), and the struct
   layouts (§4). The runtime `_start`/`exit` shim uses agnos `exit`=0, not Linux `60`.
3. **Re-freeze on every change**: whoever changes a number/signature/layout updates §2/§3/§4 here in the same
   change. The kernel is canonical; the doc tracks it; the peer tracks the doc.

## 6. Decisions (resolved — see §0)

O1 (stdin RAW), O2 (`a4 = r10`), O3 (`open(AO_DIRECTORY)` → normal fd), O4 (FAT `stat`/`link` degradation)
were all **settled 2026-05-31 (agnos-side)** and are recorded in **§0** + applied in §1a/§3. No open ABI
decisions remain; the 1.41.x surface is ✅ DECIDED and freezes per-syscall as 1.41.1/1.41.3 implement it.
New questions get appended here until decided, then moved to §0.
