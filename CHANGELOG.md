## [Unreleased]

## [1.37.5] — 2026-05-28 (**Arc-close hand-off — vendor `kashi` 0.6.0 into the kernel.** The 1.37.x extent-allocation arc closes by retiring the inline glyph machinery in `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr` and consuming kashi's freestanding font-data core (`../kashi/src/font_data.cyr`) instead. kashi 0.1.0 was extracted from agnos's own tables byte-for-byte (0 mismatches in audit), then evolved independently to 0.6.0 (PSF1/PSF2 import path, runtime registry, CP437 widening, hardening audit). Per `project_kashi_parallel_split` memory: a parallel agent owns kashi's evolution from 0.2.0 onward; agnos sessions only touch the extraction/consumption boundary. This cut IS that consumption — what was previously booked at 1.38.0 lands at 1.37.x close instead, retiring the planned 1.40.x font-separation cycle in the same motion.)

### Changed — `fb_console.cyr` consumes kashi instead of carrying its own glyph tables

- **`cyrius.cyml`** — added `[deps.kashi] path = "../kashi" modules = ["src/font_data.cyr"]`. The freestanding glyph core is zero-stdlib (uses only `store8`/`load8` + arithmetic) so a freestanding kernel can include it directly. The stdlib-using kashi library face (`src/lib.cyr`, PSF import, runtime registry) never reaches the kernel.
- **`kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`** — removed `var fb_font[1536]` (96-glyph 0x20–0x7F BSS), removed `fset16(ch, hi, lo)` packing helper (24 lines), and removed the 96-line block of `fset16(0x20, …)` … `fset16(0x7F, …)` literal-loads at the top of `fb_console_init`. Replaced with a single `kashi_font_init()` call (kashi populates both fonts' BSS internally from the same packed u64 literals). The render lookup at `fb_putc` switched from `&fb_font + (ch - 0x20) * 16` to `kashi_glyph_ptr(KASHI_FONT_VGA_8X16, ch)` with a null-pointer guard (out-of-range chars silently drop instead of indexing past the BSS).
- **`scripts/build.sh`** + **`scripts/test.sh`** — both prepend `../kashi/src/font_data.cyr` to the kernel source before the `cyrius build --no-deps` invocation. The `[deps.kashi]` block in `cyrius.cyml` documents the contract; this prepend is the mechanism. (Cyrius dep-walking would also work but requires moving `cyrius.cyml` lookup to `$ROOT/kernel/`, which fights the existing relative-include resolution pattern.)
- **Validation** — `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build **843,776 → 945,360 B** (+101,584). Size growth comes from kashi vendoring more than agnos uses: full CP437 range (224 glyphs, 0x20–0xFF) for both VGA 8x16 AND CGA 8x8 vs agnos's prior 96-glyph 0x20–0x7F single-font slice, plus the `KASHI_FONT_VGA_9X16` derived variant + accessors (`glyph_ptr`, `glyph_row`, `font_width`/`height`/`first`/`count`, `glyph_encoded`). Cyrius DCE is off by default — `CYRIUS_DCE=1` flags 141 unreachable fns (48,203 B) which would reclaim roughly half the delta; not enabled this cut to keep the build behavior identical.
- **Glyph rendering** — byte-identical to 1.37.4 by construction (kashi 0.1.0 was extracted byte-for-byte from agnos's tables; 0.2.0–0.6.0 only widened the encoded range, didn't alter the 0x20–0x7F glyph bytes). agnos renders only the 0x20–0x7F slice — the wider CP437 + 8x8 face are dormant until consumers call for them.

### Doc cleanup

- **`docs/development/roadmap.md`** — row 33 (1.38.0 = "Consume kashi font lib") and row 36 (1.40.x = "Console-font separation → kashi") rewritten to reflect both deliverables landing here at 1.37.5. 1.38.x stays open for the next own-cycle (jbd2 journaling per the existing forward plan); 1.40.x slot freed.

## [1.37.4] — 2026-05-28 (**ext-extent selftest — idempotent re-boot skip.** Iron Attempt 1373 boot-1 PASSED depth-2 with `e2fsck -fn` clean, then boot-2 against the same NVMe (extent file persisted at depth=2 from boot-1) emitted `ext-ext: no sibling leaf formed FAIL` — a test-not-idempotent bug, NOT a filesystem bug (host `e2fsck -fn /dev/nvme0n1p2` confirmed agnos-fs clean across both boots). The selftest loops from `lblk=2`, sees `eh_depth==2` after the first overwriting write, and exits before `got_sibling` (only set on depth-0→1 transitions) can flip. Fix: recognize the already-exercised state and emit a clean skip-PASS — the persisted depth-2 tree IS the durability evidence.)

### Fixed — ext-extent selftest re-boot idempotency

- **`ext2.cyr`** — `ext2_extent_write_selftest`: after `ext2_get_inode` confirms `/extseed.dat` is extent-mapped, check the inline-root depth. If `eh_depth == 2`, a prior boot's run already drove the full ladder and persisted it — emit `ext-ext: /extseed.dat already at depth=2 (prior boot) -- skip PASS` and return 0. The loop-based grow-detection (`got_sibling` requires observing the depth-0→1 transition mid-loop) can't be re-derived from a fully-grown tree, and re-seeding the file would discard the cross-boot durability proof. Skip-with-PASS preserves the evidence.
- **Validation** — QEMU two-boot test on the same NVMe image: boot-1 self-seeds + reaches `depth-2 PASS` + `append PASS` + `e2fsck -fn` clean (unchanged from 1.37.3); boot-2 against the persisted image emits the new `skip PASS` line and proceeds to scheduler activation. `ext-extent-smoke.sh` (fresh-FS, single-boot) PASS unchanged. Production build 842,840 → **843,776 B** (+936 — the new branch + skip-PASS string live in `ext2_extent_write_selftest`'s body, which is currently always-emitted; DCE-off baseline. The function itself stays unreachable in production because main.cyr's call is `#ifdef EXT2_EXTENT_WRITE_SELFTEST` only).
- **Iron** — closes the boot-2 false-FAIL noise from Attempt 1373; the arc's iron-burn proof (boot-1 depth-2 PASS + e2fsck-clean reboot survival) stands as iron-validated for 1.37.x.

## [1.37.3] — 2026-05-27 (**ext4 extent allocation — depth-2 tree growth.** When all 4 inline-root index slots fill (4 full leaves), the tree now grows to depth 2 — the root's 4 index entries spill into an INDEX block and the root becomes a single index entry pointing at it — and further appends descend root → index block → leaf. This completes the on-demand grow ladder (0→1→2); the AGNOS extent allocator now handles every realistic file shape. Continues 1.37.2's multi-leaf split. Audit § 5 / agnosticos [`ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md).)

### Added — depth-2 extent tree (index-block grow + descend + index-node checksum)

- **`ext2.cyr`** — `ext2_extent_grow_indepth2`: spills the inline root's 4 index entries into a freshly-allocated INDEX block (`eh_depth=1`, `eh_max=(blocksize-12)/12`, with its metadata_csum node checksum), then rewrites the inline root as `eh_depth=2` with one index entry (`ei_block` = lowest logical, `ei_leaf_hi:lo` = the index block). The 1.37.2 depth-1 path now grows to depth 2 instead of failing when the inline root's 4 index slots are full.
- **`ext2_extent_add_leaf_to_idxblk`** — the depth-2 analog of `add_sibling_leaf`: builds a new leaf (one extent, csum-stamped) and appends an index entry to the index block (re-stamping the index block's node csum). Index-block-full → returns 0 (sibling index block / depth-3 deferred — unreachable for realistic files: needs `eh_max` full leaves ≈ 115 k extents at 4 KB).
- **`ext2_extent_append_block`** — new depth-2 path: descend root → rightmost index block → rightmost leaf, then **extend** / **insert** into the leaf, or (leaf full) **add a sibling leaf** under the index block. The index block is held in `ext2_indirect_buf_l1` (free during extent writes — extent inodes never use the single-indirect scratch) while the leaf builds in `ext2_extent_buf`. The reader (`ext2_extent_logical_to_physical`) already walked depth ≤ 5, so reads worked unchanged. Data + tree blocks all count toward `i_blocks`.
- **Validation** — `ext-extent-smoke.sh` now drives the tree to depth 2: sparse writes (logical 2,4,6,…) climb root-full→depth-1 grow→4 sibling leaves→**depth-1→2 grow** (selftest loops until `eh_depth==2`, then asserts). Reached `final depth=2 root_entries=1 size=11141184` (11.1 MB sparse, ~1360 extents across 4 leaves + the new index block). **`e2fsck -fn` clean** on the default `mkfs.ext4` (metadata_csum) image — the load-bearing gate, proving BOTH grows, every sibling split, the leaf **and** index-node checksums, all index entries, the inode checksum, and `i_blocks` are correct. `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. (`ext2-write-smoke` shows pre-existing symlink-test failures, present at HEAD without this work — **not a regression** from depth-2; the indirect block-allocation path it shares is unaffected.) Production build 838,048 → **842,840 B**.
- **Next**: the arc's iron burn (user-driven) — extent allocation's first real-hardware touch; the depth-0/1 path covers every realistic file, depth-2 is the completeness ceiling.

## [1.37.2] — OPEN (not yet tagged) (**ext4 extent allocation — multi-leaf (depth-1 sibling split).** When the depth-1 leaf fills, a SIBLING leaf is now allocated and a 2nd (3rd, 4th) index entry is added to the inline root — so a fragmented file can span up to 4 leaves (≈ 4 × eh_max extents) without needing depth 2. Continues 1.37.1's depth-0→1 grow. Audit § 5 / agnosticos [`ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md).)

### Added — sibling-leaf split (depth-1, up to 4 leaves)

- **`ext2.cyr`** — `ext2_extent_add_sibling_leaf`: builds a new leaf block holding the one new extent (with its metadata_csum node checksum) and appends an index entry to the inline root (`ei_block`/`ei_leaf_hi:lo`, `eh_entries++`). `ext2_extent_append_block`'s depth-1 path now decides per-append: **extend** the rightmost leaf's last extent, **insert** into it if it has room, else (leaf full + new entry needed) **add a sibling leaf** — unless the inline root's 4 index slots are also full, which returns 0 (depth-2 grow deferred to 1.37.3). Out-of-order/hole-fill still deferred. The new leaf + data block both count toward `i_blocks`.
- **Validation** — `ext-extent-smoke.sh` now drives the leaf to overflow: sparse writes (logical 2,4,6,…) fill the inline root → grow to depth 1 → fill the leaf (eh_max) → **add a sibling leaf** (selftest loops until `eh_depth==1` with `eh_entries==2`, then asserts; reached a ~2.7 MB sparse file across 2 leaves). **`e2fsck -fn` clean** on the default `mkfs.ext4` (metadata_csum) image — proves the grow, the sibling split, BOTH leaf-node checksums, the root index, and the inode checksum are all correct. **No regression**: `ext2-write-smoke` (indirect) PASS, `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 836,032 → **838,048 B**.
- **Next (1.37.3)**: depth-2 grow (root index full → spill the 4 index entries into an index block, root becomes depth 2) + the arc's iron burn (user-driven — extent allocation's first real-hardware touch).

## [1.37.1] — OPEN (not yet tagged) (**ext4 extent allocation — depth 0→1 tree growth.** When the inline extent root (4 entries) fills, the tree now grows to depth 1 — the root's extents spill into a leaf BLOCK and the root becomes a single index entry — and further appends land in that leaf. Continues the 1.37.0 depth-0 append. Audit § 5 / agnosticos [`ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md).)

### Added — depth-1 extent tree (leaf-overflow grow + leaf-node checksum)

- **`ext2.cyr`** — `ext2_extent_grow_indepth`: spills the inline root's 4 extents into a freshly-allocated leaf block (`eh_depth=0`, `eh_max=(blocksize-12)/12`), then rewrites the inline root as `eh_depth=1` with one index entry (`ei_block` = lowest logical, `ei_leaf_hi:lo` = leaf block). `ext2_extent_leaf_place` extends-or-inserts an already-allocated block into a leaf block. `ext2_extent_append_block` now: depth 0 → on inline-root-full, grow then place in the new leaf; depth 1 → descend to the rightmost leaf and place (leaf-full → 0, deferred to 1.37.2); depth > 1 → deferred. The data + tree-leaf blocks both count toward `i_blocks`.
- **`ext2_extent_node_csum_stamp`** — the metadata_csum extent **tree-block** checksum (the inline root needs none — the inode checksum covers it; on-disk leaf/index blocks need a tail). Same seed as the inode csum: `crc32c(crc32c(crc32c(seed, ino), i_generation), node[0..tail))` at `EXT4_EXTENT_TAIL_OFFSET = 12 + eh_max*12`. Threaded `inode_num` through `ext2_extent_bmap_alloc`/`append_block` for it.
- **Validation** — `ext-extent-smoke.sh` extended: sparse writes at logical blocks 2,4,6,8,10 force the root full at block 6 and the **grow at block 8** (selftest asserts final `eh_depth == 1`), then **`e2fsck -fn` clean** on the default `mkfs.ext4` (metadata_csum) image — the load-bearing gate, proving the grow + the leaf-node checksum + the inode-checksum recompute are all correct; file grew to 41024 B, block 2 = `0xAB`. **No regression**: `ext2-write-smoke` (indirect) PASS, `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 831,728 → **836,032 B**.
- **Next (1.37.2)**: multi-leaf (2nd leaf when the first fills → 2nd root index entry) + depth>1 + iron burn.

## [1.37.0] — 2026-05-27 (**ext4 extent ALLOCATION arc — opened.** First of the heavy big-write cycles. The 1.33.x WRITE arc reached file-write via *indirect-mapped* inodes (no `EXTENTS_FL`), so it can't grow an inode that already uses extents (anything `mkfs.ext4`/Linux created). This arc adds the extent write path: allocate a block, then extend/insert an extent + `eh_entries`/`ee_len`/`ee_start_hi` accounting, with tree-splits for full nodes. Audit-doc-first: agnosticos [`ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext4-extent-alloc-prior-art.md) (Linux `extents.c` + FreeBSD `ext4_ext_*` + e2fsprogs `ext2fs_extent_insert`). **1.37.0 = depth-0 append** (RELEASED); 1.37.1 = leaf-overflow split (depth 1); 1.37.2 = multi-leaf/deeper splits + iron burn.)

### Added — depth-0 extent append (grow an `EXTENTS_FL` inode)

`ext2.cyr` can now allocate blocks into an extent-mapped inode whose tree fits the inline root (`eh_depth == 0`, ≤ 4 extents) — the base-stage majority (a contiguous file is a *single* extent of up to 32768 blocks).

- **`ext2_extent_append_block(inode_buf, lblk)`** — depth-0 allocation: empty tree → write the first extent; else allocate (goal = the block right after the last extent, for contiguity) and either **extend the last extent** (`ee_len += 1`, when `lblk` is its next logical block, the new physical block is contiguous, and `ee_len < 32768`) or **insert a new leaf extent** into the inline root (if `eh_entries < eh_max`), with `eh_entries`/`ee_len`/`ee_start_hi:lo` (48-bit split) accounting. Root-full → frees the block + returns 0 (split deferred to 1.37.1); `eh_depth > 0` append + out-of-order/hole-fill inserts also return 0 (deferred). The root lives in the inode, so the shared `ext2_write_at` tail (`ext2_put_inode`, incl. the metadata_csum inode-checksum recompute) persists it — no separate tree-node write at depth 0.
- **`ext2_extent_bmap_alloc`** — resolve-or-append: existing blocks overwrite in place (works at any depth via the reader), sparse/EOF blocks append. `ext2_write_at` now routes by `EXTENTS_FL` to this instead of rejecting extent inodes (the old "write to extent inode unsupported" path is gone).
- **Validation** — new `scripts/ext-extent-smoke.sh`: on a **default `mkfs.ext4` (metadata_csum,64bit,extent)** image with an `-d`-seeded extent file, the kernel appends 64 B past EOF (logical block 1) and **`e2fsck -fn` is clean** — the load-bearing gate, proving the extent-root edit + inode-checksum recompute are valid — plus the file grew to 4160 B with `0xAB` at offset 4096 (`ext-ext: append PASS`). **No regression**: `ext2-write-smoke` (indirect path) still PASS (W1–W5 + e2fsck clean). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 828,528 → **831,728 B**.

## [1.36.2] — 2026-05-27 (**Refactor — `main.cyr` selftest extraction.** Declutter the boot orchestrator: the trailing block of compile-gated boot self-tests + the kybernet launch move out of `main.cyr`, leaving it the boot-init sequence. Pure source reorganization — **production build byte-for-byte identical** (same sha256), behavior provably unchanged.)

### Changed — split the boot self-tests + launch out of `main.cyr`

`main.cyr` had grown to 1661 LOC: boot init, then ~400 LOC of compile-gated `#ifdef *_SELFTEST` / `*_SMOKE` hermetic+live checks, then the `kybernet()` launch. The trailing selftest block and the launch moved into siblings, leaving `main.cyr` as the **1244-LOC boot-init sequence**:

- `core/selftests.cyr` — the compile-gated boot self-tests (DNS / ICMP / TCP / NTP / MMAP / RTC / HARDENING / TCP_LISTEN). Production sets no flags → these compile to nothing.
- `core/boot_finish.cyr` — the boot's final act: `kybernet()` (PID 1, the shell loop) + the `Halted.` fallback. Included **after** `selftests.cyr` so test builds run their checks first, then launch — preserving execution order.
- `agnos.cyr` include order: `… boot_shim → main → selftests → boot_finish`.

The FS (FATFS/EXFAT/EXT2) + KTEST selftests stay inline in `main.cyr` — they're interspersed mid-boot-sequence (tied to where the state they test is set up), not a cleanly-extractable trailing block.

- **Validation** — **production byte-identical** (`18e23876…`, 828,528 B; selftests are `#ifdef`'d out of production, so the binary is unchanged). Test-build ordering confirmed — the moved block still runs after init + before launch: `dns-smoke` 3/3, `hardening-smoke` 1/1, `tcp-listen-smoke` 2/2 (the last explicitly runs just before the kybernet launch). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11.
- **Refactor cycle** — with the `net.cyr` split (1.36.0/1.36.1), the 1.36.x refactor cycle's planned targets are done. `ext2.cyr`→1.39.x, `shell.cyr`→1.41.x remain deferred until those subsystems are next touched.

## [1.36.1] — 2026-05-27 (**`net.cyr` split, part 2: app-protocols + ingress — net.cyr refactor COMPLETE.** Finishes the split started at 1.36.0: the per-protocol layer and the ingress/demux path move out, leaving `net.cyr` as the L2/L3 core. Pure source reorganization — **build byte-for-byte identical** (same sha256), behavior provably unchanged.)

### Changed — split the app-protocol + ingress layers out of `net.cyr`

`net.cyr` went from a 2019-LOC catch-all to a focused **272-LOC L2/L3 core** (Ethernet / ARP-build / IPv4 / UDP transport + the UDP listener table). The rest moved verbatim into siblings, included in their original order so the concatenated compilation unit is unchanged:

- `net_dhcp.cyr` — DHCP client (RFC 2131)
- `net_icmp.cyr` — ICMP echo/ping + error awareness
- `net_dns.cyr` — DNS stub resolver + TTL cache
- `net_ntp.cyr` — NTP/SNTP client
- `net_rtc.cyr` — RTC boot clock + `civil_to_unix`
- `net_ingress.cyr` — the receive/dispatch path: `net_handle_arp`/`net_handle_udp`, `ip_safe_payload_len`, `net_poll`, `net_recv_udp` (this was physically at the *bottom* of `net.cyr`, after the protocols, so it becomes its own trailing module to keep the include order — hence the binary — identical)

Combined with `net_tcp.cyr` (1.36.0), the network stack is now 8 focused files (core + ingress + 5 protocols + TCP), mirroring how mature stacks organize `net/`. No logic touched; the demux's cross-file handler references resolve in the same compilation unit.

- **Validation** — **byte-identical build** (`512734b3…`, 828,528 B) before vs after the split (the strongest behavior-preservation proof); plus the full net smoke suite green across the moved files: `dns-smoke` 3/3, `icmp-smoke` 1/1, `ntp-smoke` 1/1, `rtc-smoke` 1/1, `tcp-smoke` 4/4, `tcp-listen-smoke` 2/2; `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11.
- **Refactor cycle status** — the `net.cyr` split (the 1.36.x headline) is **complete**. `ext2.cyr` split stays deferred to the 1.39.x VFS arc; `shell.cyr` to 1.41.x.

## [1.36.0] — 2026-05-27 (**Refactor cycle open — `net.cyr` split, part 1: TCP extraction.** The 1.35.x arc grew `net.cyr` into a 2019-LOC catch-all across 10 protocol sections. This cycle splits it along those boundaries, starting with the largest. Pure source reorganization — **the compiled `build/agnos` is byte-for-byte identical** (same sha256) before and after, so behavior is provably unchanged.)

### Changed — extract the TCP stack into `kernel/core/net_tcp.cyr`

The TCP region (state machine + conn table, retransmit/B2, server-side listen/accept — ~780 LOC, lines 1242–EOF) moved verbatim out of `net.cyr` into a new `net_tcp.cyr`, included immediately after `net.cyr` in `agnos.cyr`. `net.cyr` (now ~1240 LOC) keeps the L2/L3 core: Ethernet/ARP/IPv4/UDP transport, the UDP listener table, DHCP, ICMP, DNS, NTP, RTC, and the shared `net_poll` demux (which forward-references `net_handle_tcp` / `tcp_retx_tick` in `net_tcp.cyr`, resolved in the same compilation unit). No logic touched.

- **Validation** — **byte-identical build** (`637340…`, 828,528 B) before vs after the split, the strongest proof of behavior preservation; plus `tcp-smoke` 4/4 + `tcp-listen-smoke` 2/2 (the TCP selftest builds, which differ from production, confirm `net_tcp.cyr` compiles cleanly in those configs), `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11.
- **Next (1.36.x)** — part 2 extracts the app-protocol layer (DHCP / DNS / NTP / ICMP / RTC) into per-protocol files; `net.cyr` ends as the L2/L3 core. `ext2.cyr` (FS) deferred to the 1.39.x VFS arc; `shell.cyr` to the 1.41.x agnoshi split.

## [1.35.7] — 2026-05-27 (**1.35.x arc-close hardening (passes 1 + 2)** — the 1.35.x line added untrusted-input parsers (DNS/ICMP/NTP/TCP) + new arithmetic; this arc-close hardening tightens it *without restructuring* (refactor ops reserved for the 1.36.x cycle). **Pass 1**: forged-IP-length over-read clamp at the ingress demux. **Pass 2**: wrap/range edges (TCP seq-wrap, RTC year bound). Audit: agnosticos [`arc-close-hardening-1-35.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/arc-close-hardening-1-35.md).)

**Pass 2 — wrap/range edges:**

### Fixed — TCP sequence-number wrap (RCV.NXT)

A sweep of every SND.NXT/RCV.NXT update found that **all mask `& 0xFFFFFFFF` except two** `store64(cb + 40, seq + 1)` sites in `net_handle_tcp` (SYN_SENT→ESTABLISHED and FIN_WAIT). The SYN_SENT one is a real (rare) bug: a peer whose ISN is near 2³² (`0xFFFFFFFF`) sets RCV.NXT to `0x100000000` instead of `0`, so the peer's first data segment carries the wrapped seq `0`, never equals `expected`, and the in-order accept (`seq == expected`) silently rejects everything → the connection stalls (~1-in-2³² per connection). Both sites now mask, matching the other six seq-update sites (incl. the passive-open path that already did). One-character guard; no new behavior on the common path.

### Fixed — RTC implausible-year upper bound

`rtc_read_unix` rejected `year < 1970` but not absurdly-high years; a corrupt CMOS century/year register could seed a far-future wall clock (bounded, NTP-corrected, but asserted as real until then). Now also rejects `year > 2200` → returns 0 (clock unset, `date` says so) so NTP sets it instead.

### Reviewed clean (no change)
`tcp_rx_append` (flow-clamped + power-of-two ring mask), mmap arena exhaustion (`sys_mmap` pre-counts free regions; mid-loop alloc failure is unreachable in the single-core model — flagged for the future SMP arc, not pre-emptively rolled back), `munmap` partial range (idempotent per-region), DNS cache eviction (bounded scans, no loop; name-region indexing safe), UDP length (IP-payload-derived, pass-1-clamped). Details in the audit doc § Pass 2.

- **Validation** — the fixes are inline wrap/range guards with no new valid-path behavior, so validated by **no-regression**: `tcp-smoke` 4/4, `tcp-listen-smoke` 2/2 (handshake/data/FIN/passive-open unaffected), `rtc-smoke` 1/1 (live ~2026 CMOS read still seeds), `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. The wrap fix's correctness rests on the now-uniform masking across all 8 seq-update sites. Production build 828,464 → **828,528 B**.

**Pass 1 — ingress over-read:**

### Security — clamp the IPv4 total-length at the ingress demux

`net_poll()` (the single IPv4 ingress) trusted the IP header's **total-length** field: it computed `ip_payload_len = ip_total - ip_ihl` guarding only against underflow, never clamping `ip_total` to the bytes actually received. A frame claiming `ip_total = 65535` in a physically 60-byte packet produced a ~65 KB payload length handed to the proto handler — making each downstream handler **over-read `net_rx_pkt` past the real frame**: ICMP echo would *reflect* the stale/adjacent bytes back to the sender (a remote info-leak), UDP would copy up to ~1 KB of post-frame bytes into the receive buffers, and TCP's data-segment append would over-read into the rx ring. The handlers' own bounds checks are all *relative to* `ip_payload_len`, so the demux is the one place to enforce the actually-received length.

- **`net.cyr`** — new `ip_safe_payload_len(ip_total, ip_ihl, avail)`: rejects `ip_ihl < 20` and `ip_total < ip_ihl`, **clamps `ip_total` to `avail` (`pkt_len - 14`)**, rejects a truncated frame whose claimed header doesn't fit, else returns the safe payload length. `net_poll` calls it and dispatches only on a `>= 0` result. Convergent with Linux `ip_rcv` / lwIP `ip4_input` / *BSD `ip_input` (the "never trust the length field — validate against received" rule). For valid frames (including Ethernet-min-padded ones, where `ip_total < avail` is left untouched) the result is identical to before — **no behavioral change for real traffic**.
- **Validation** — new `scripts/hardening-smoke.sh` (`HARDENING_SELFTEST=1`): `hardening: ip-clamp PASS`, a hermetic table over `ip_safe_payload_len` (valid pass-through, padded-frame untouched, forged `total>avail` clamped, `ihl<20` / `total<ihl` / truncated-frame rejected, exact-fit boundary). **No-regression confirmed**: icmp-smoke 1/1, tcp-smoke 4/4, dns-smoke 3/3, ntp-smoke 1/1 — valid traffic across all three protocols still flows. `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 828,112 → **828,464 B**.
- **Reviewed clean (no change):** `dns_skip_name` (per-byte bounds + 128-iter compression-loop cap), `dns_parse_answer`, `tcp_parse_mss`, `net_handle_tcp` header-length guards, `ntp_parse_unix` (caller gates `n >= 48`). Pass-2 candidates (mmap arena exhaustion, RTC century edges, TCP seq-wrap, UDP length-field defense-in-depth) catalogued in the audit doc — not yet scheduled.

## [1.35.6] — 2026-05-27 (**DNS cache** — the resolver's robustness item: an 8-entry, TTL-respecting positive cache so repeated lookups (`ping`/`ntp`/the eventual `ark`-fetch to one host) don't re-query. Closes the last of the 1.35.x catchup tidbits. Audit: agnosticos [`dns-stub-resolver-prior-art.md` § 9](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/dns-stub-resolver-prior-art.md).)

### Added — DNS positive cache (TTL-aware)

The 1.35.0 stub re-queried the nameserver on every `dns`/`ping`/`ntp <host>` — functionally fine but wasteful over a link we'd rather not hammer, and a drag on the eventual `ark` fetch (many requests to one host). A small lwIP `dns.c`-style cache fixes it. (The other two items often lumped under "DNS robustness" were already shipped at 1.35.0: `dns_parse_answer` already walks all answer RRs and skips CNAME/AAAA to take the first valid A — multi-A / CNAME-chain — and `dns_resolve` already does one midpoint retransmit. So this cut is the cache + the TTL the parser had been discarding.)

- **`net.cyr`** — `dns_cache_find` / `dns_cache_put`: 8 slots (parallel module-global arrays + a 512-byte name region), linear scan, exact-name match, not-expired gate, evict-soonest-to-expire on a full insert. `dns_parse_answer` now records the matched A record's TTL into `dns_last_ttl` (it sits `TYPE+CLASS+TTL` = 6 bytes before the RDATA, which the answer walk had been stepping over). `dns_resolve` checks the cache first (instant return, no NIC needed) and inserts on a successful live lookup. TTL is **clamped to [10 s, 3600 s]** — the floor defends against 0-TTL thrash, the ceiling means even a misbehaving authoritative TTL self-heals within an hour (the kernel has no cache-flush verb yet). Positive-only (no NXDOMAIN pinning); names > 63 bytes resolve but aren't cached. No locking — relies on the same single-core invariant as the rest of the net stack (the future SMP arc unwinds it).
- **Validation** — `dns-smoke.sh` extended to 3 hermetic gates: the existing `dns: parse PASS`, plus new `dns: cache PASS` — TTL extraction (the hand-built answer carries `ttl=256`), a put→find hit returning the right IP, an un-cached miss, and the expired-entry gate (a hand-placed past-expiry slot must miss). Live `example.com` lookup also succeeded under SLIRP. `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 825,632 → **828,112 B**.
- **Still deferred** (audit § 9): negative caching, multi-nameserver fallback (DHCP opt 6 can list several; only the first is captured), and a cache-flush / `dig`-style surface — when a consumer asks.

## [1.35.5] — 2026-05-27 (**RTC boot clock** — the local companion to 1.35.2's NTP. The kernel now reads the CMOS RTC at boot and seeds a wall clock *without a network*, so `ntp_now()`/`date` work from the first second of uptime; NTP refines/overrides it when a server is reachable. Opened with a cyrius toolchain-pin move (6.0.1 → 6.0.3). Audit: agnosticos [`rtc-boot-clock-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/rtc-boot-clock-prior-art.md).)

### Added — RTC boot clock (CMOS read + `civil_to_unix`)

1.35.2 gave the kernel a wall clock, but only after a successful SNTP round-trip — with no network (or no reachable time server) `date` said "not synced." Every PC has a battery-backed RTC that already knows the date; reading it at boot is the obvious local fallback, and it gives the eventual TLS-cert-validity path a plausible clock before any network is up. The NTP audit had explicitly flagged *"the RTC was never read."*

- **`net.cyr`** — `rtc_read_unix()` reads the MC146818 CMOS RTC (ports 0x70/0x71): bounded UIP-clear wait + read-twice-until-stable (OSDev/Linux/SeaBIOS convergent idiom), BCD + 12h-mode normalization per Status Register B, century register (when it decodes plausibly) else `2000 + yy`, sanity-reject `< 1970`. `civil_to_unix(y,mo,d,h,mi,s)` (Howard Hinnant's branch-free days-from-civil) converts to Unix seconds — the exact inverse of the `date` breakdown, and a reusable primitive for a future `time()` syscall / RTC-write path. `net_clock_seed_rtc()` sets the existing `net_unix_time`/`net_ntp_synctick` base (so `ntp_now()` is unchanged) and a new `net_clock_source` (1=RTC); `ntp_sync` sets source=2 (NTP overrides). x86-only — `net.cyr` is compiled inside `#ifdef ARCH_X86_64`, so no aarch64 stub.
- **`main.cyr`** — seeds the wall clock from the RTC in the x86 boot sequence (after the timer is live), printing `Wall clock: RTC seed Unix <t>`.
- **`shell.cyr`** — `date` now prints the source tag (`[RTC]` / `[NTP]`); the "not synced" message becomes "clock unset" (the RTC usually seeds it at boot).
- **Validation** — new `scripts/rtc-smoke.sh` (`RTC_SELFTEST=1`): `rtc: clock PASS` — hermetic `civil_to_unix` anchors (2024-01-01 = 1704067200, +3661 s, 2024-03-01 leap boundary = 1709251200, epoch = 0) + BCD decode, plus a live-bounded `rtc_read_unix()` against QEMU's emulated CMOS (asserts a post-2020 epoch — the read decoded the host's ~May-2026 date correctly). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 822,864 → **825,632 B**.
- **Deferred** (audit § 8): RTC *write* (`systohc`), IRQ8 periodic/alarm, and a userland `time()`/`gettimeofday` syscall (would build on `civil_to_unix`).

### Changed — cyrius toolchain pin 6.0.1 → 6.0.3

The kernel `cyrius.cyml` pin moved from 6.0.1 to 6.0.3 after a byte-for-byte A/B: the same `kernel/agnos.cyr` source compiled with each toolchain produced an **identical** `build/agnos` (same sha256, 822,864 B) — so 6.0.3 "creates the same work" literally, and "performs the same" by construction. CI had been green on the pinned 6.0.1; since the binary is identical, CI on 6.0.3 produces the exact artifact it was already validating. Confirmed via `CYRIUS_HOME=~/.cyrius/versions/<ver>` direct-wrapper builds (the `cyrius build` default uses the `current` toolchain and only *warns* on pin drift unless `CYRIUS_STRICT_PIN=1`). This also silences the editor/LSP drift warning the right way — by validating + adopting, not suppressing. (Note: the agnosticos `scripts/` boot-pipeline project stays on its own 5.11.59 pin — separate Cyrius project, out of scope.)

## [1.35.4] — 2026-05-27 (**`munmap`** — the natural pair to 1.35.3's `mmap`. Releases an anonymous region and returns its physical 2 MB pages to the PMM, so a process that churns mappings no longer leaks the arena until teardown. Closes the mmap/munmap pair. Audit: agnosticos [`mmap-prior-art.md` § 7](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/mmap-prior-art.md).)

### Added — `munmap` (syscall 28)

`mmap` (1.35.3) could hand out memory but never take it back — the global bump arena (256 MB→1 GB) and the 16 MB physical pool only recovered at process teardown, a leak for any consumer that grows *and shrinks* (arena allocators, a resizable heap). `munmap(addr, length)` closes the pair.

- **`proc.cyr`** — `sys_munmap(addr, length)`: validate `addr` is 2 MB-aligned and inside the arena `[0x10000000, 0x40000000)`, round `length` up to 2 MB, walk to the PD once, then per 2 MB region recover the phys from the (present) PD entry, `proc_unmap_page` (clears both the kernel and KPTI user PD), `invlpg` the vaddr (drop the stale huge-page TLB entry — the live process must not keep a window into now-freed physical), and `pmm_free_2mb(phys)`. Already-unmapped regions are skipped (idempotent, no double-free); non-arena addresses are rejected (never touches code / stacks / kernel). A LIFO reclaim rewinds the bump cursor when the freed range sits exactly at the arena top, so alloc-then-free round-trips don't bleed vaddr space. Deliberately **not** Linux's VMA-tree model (no `vm_area_struct` splitting/merging) — AGNOS has no VMA layer, so `munmap` is the literal inverse of the bump `mmap`, not a general range op (audit § 7).
- **`syscall.cyr`** — dispatch entry 28 = `sys_munmap(arg1, arg2)`. Dispatch table now 29 entries (0–28); aarch64 gets a `sys_munmap` stub.
- **Validation** — `MMAP_SELFTEST` / `mmap-smoke.sh` extended (the mmap/munmap pair shares one test surface): new `munmap: pmm-reuse PASS` — `pmm_free_2mb` rejects misaligned / kernel-region / out-of-range addresses (the guards `sys_munmap` leans on), and an alloc→free→alloc round-trip proves freed physical is genuinely reusable with the free-count restored each cycle. The full `sys_munmap` PD-walk + `proc_unmap_page` + `invlpg` path rides those proven primitives (no live user-proc at boot). `mmap-smoke.sh` 2/2, `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 821,856 → **822,864 B**.
- **Housekeeping** — dropped the stale `scripts/build.sh` "banner cleanup" roadmap row: the banner already validates `multiboot2 (ELF64): OK` (a real ELF-class/magic/entry check) and prints the Path-C `Boot: gnoboot + OVMF … / install-usb.sh` line; the "pending shim rewrite" label it referenced was removed cycles ago.
- **Deferred** (audit § 6/7): `munmap` of partial / 4 KB-granular regions (needs the 4 KB user-paging level); a vaddr free-list to reclaim non-top arena holes (only if a consumer shows real fragmentation).

## [1.35.3] — 2026-05-27 (**anonymous `mmap`** — the first new *functional* syscall since v1.21.0. A process can now request a fresh, zero-filled region of its own address space, the substrate a heap-grower / arena allocator needs. Independent of the FS arcs; the comms arc (1.35.0–1.35.2) is closed. Audit-doc-first: agnosticos [`mmap-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/mmap-prior-art.md).)

### Added — anonymous `mmap` (syscall 27), 2 MB-granular

The kernel had no way to hand a running process more address space — code, stack, and ELF segments were all mapped at spawn and never grew. `mmap(length)` (anonymous, zero-filled) closes that. It is the first new *functional* syscall since the v1.21.0 buildout; it adds a pure memory facility, not socket/crypto surface, so the attack-surface story stays anchored on the **absence** of AF_ALG / socket / `splice` rather than a fixed table size.

- **`pmm.cyr`** — new `pmm_alloc_2mb` / `pmm_free_2mb` / `pmm_count_2mb_free`. The user VMM is **2 MB huge pages only**, and the existing ELF/stack idiom maps a full huge page while reserving only 1 of its 512 underlying 4 KB pages — a latent aliasing hazard a repeatedly-called `mmap` must **not** inherit. So `mmap` gets a real 2 MB-contiguous allocator: scan the 4 KB bitmap's eight 2 MB-aligned regions (region 0 is the kernel) for one entirely free, mark all 512, return the 2 MB-aligned base (0 = none free; the 16 MB pool fragments under single-page allocs).
- **`proc.cyr`** — `sys_mmap(length)`: round `length` up to 2 MB, pre-check `pmm_count_2mb_free()` so the map loop can't fail part-way, then per 2 MB chunk `pmm_alloc_2mb` → identity-map for kernel access (`vmm_map(phys,phys,0x83)` if not already) → zero-fill → `proc_map_page(proc_get_cr3(proc_current), vaddr, phys)` (US=1) into the caller's address space. A global bump cursor `mmap_next_vaddr` runs 256 MB → 1 GB (clear of code and per-pid stacks; each address space is its own CR3, so a monotonic global cursor never collides). Returns the base vaddr or 0 (MAP_FAILED). `addr`/`prot`/`flags`/`fd`/`offset` accepted-and-ignored (always anonymous, R/W/U).
- **`syscall.cyr`** — dispatch entry 27 = `sys_mmap(arg1)`. Slot 26 was already `write_boot_checkpoint` (an iron-boot diagnostic), so `mmap` takes 27; dispatch table is now 28 entries (0–27). aarch64 gets a `sys_mmap` stub (x86-only for now).
- **Validation** — new `scripts/mmap-smoke.sh` (`MMAP_SELFTEST=1`): hermetic `mmap: pmm2mb PASS` — `pmm_alloc_2mb` returns distinct, non-overlapping, 2 MB-aligned regions; the free-count drops by the alloc count and is restored on `pmm_free_2mb`; the length-rounding is exact (4 KB→2 MB, 2 MB→2 MB, 2 MB+1→4 MB). The full map-into-process path rides the iron-proven `proc_map_page` huge-page idiom (no live user-proc at boot to drive it). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 819,888 → **821,856 B**.
- **Deferred** (audit § 6): `munmap` (the natural pair, syscall 28 — v1 maps without reclaim, freed at process teardown); 4 KB-granular `mmap` (needs a 4 KB user-paging level — a large VMM arc); file-backed `mmap` (needs the VFS page cache); `MAP_FIXED` / placement hints / `mremap`.

## [1.35.2] — 2026-05-27 (**NTP/SNTP client** — the kernel's first wall clock, set from a one-shot SNTP query. The last AGNOS-side networking-comms item after DNS / ICMP / TCP-hardening; the substrate TLS/HTTP need — reliable TCP + name resolution + a wall clock — is now complete. The 1.35.x line: 1.35.0 catchup (docs + DNS + ICMP) → 1.35.1 TCP hardening (B0–B4) → 1.35.2 NTP.)

### Added — NTP/SNTP client + the kernel's first wall clock (1.35.x comms)

The kernel had **no time-of-day** — only `timer_ticks` (a 100 Hz counter); the RTC was never read. A unicast SNTP client (RFC 4330 simple mode) now sets a wall clock from one UDP/123 query. This is the third networking-comms item (after DNS + ICMP + TCP hardening) and the last AGNOS-side prerequisite before TLS (cert-validity checks need a real clock). Audit-doc-first: agnosticos [`ntp-sntp-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ntp-sntp-prior-art.md) (RFC 4330/5905 + musl/OpenBSD/chrony-simple + lwIP sntp).

- **`net.cyr`** — `ntp_sync(server_ip)` builds the 48-byte SNTP request (byte 0 = `0x1B`, rest zero), sends to `:123` from a fixed ephemeral port (DNS-style lazy bind), polls for the response, validates mode 4, and reads the **Transmit Timestamp** (offset 40). `ntp_parse_unix` converts NTP→Unix (subtract the `2208988800` 1900↔1970 delta). `net_unix_time` + `net_ntp_synctick` hold the synced base; `ntp_now()` returns a free-running wall clock = base + elapsed-ticks/100. Reuses the existing UDP transport + (for hostnames) `dns_resolve`. Simple mode only — no offset/delay calc, no clock discipline, no 2036-era handling (audit § 7).
- **`shell.cyr`** — `ntp <server>` (dotted-quad or DNS-resolved, like `ping`) syncs + prints the Unix time; `date` prints `ntp_now()` as Unix seconds + a UTC `HH:MM:SS` breakdown (or "not synced").
- **Validation** — new `scripts/ntp-smoke.sh` (`NTP_SELFTEST=1`): hermetic `ntp: parse PASS` — a synthetic response's transmit timestamp (NTP `3913056000`) converts to Unix `1704067200` (2024-01-01 00:00:00 UTC) and a +3661 s value breaks down to `01:01:01`. Live SNTP sync is the manual `ntp <server>` verb (SLIRP has no NTP server). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 816,544 → **819,888 B**.

## [1.35.1] — 2026-05-27 (**cycle-open** — **TCP hardening**, the reliable-fetch enabler. The minimal SYN/ACK/FIN state machine (1.32.0) connects/sends/recvs but has no retransmit, no RX window, no MSS negotiation — fine for DHCP/DNS/ICMP request-reply, not for a sustained `ark`/`nous` fetch. This cycle hardens it. The 1.35.0 catchup cut — full docs sweep + DNS stub + ICMP/ping — is closed; legacy virtio-net stays back-burnered; NTP/SNTP queues after TCP; TLS stays with the cyrius agent. **Lean cycle-open**: VERSION 1.35.0 → 1.35.1, this header; multi-source audit-doc-first per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]], then bites.)

### Changed — TCP hardening B0 + B1: in-order receive ring (the keystone)

The minimal TCP (1.32.0) kept only the **latest** received segment — the ESTABLISHED path did `net_copy_buf(rx_buf, …); store64(cb+56, data_len)`, overwriting a 256-byte buffer per segment — so **any multi-segment transfer was silently truncated**, and it advertised an 8192 window while holding 248 bytes. Audit-doc-first: agnosticos [`tcp-hardening-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/tcp-hardening-prior-art.md) (RFC 9293/1122/6298 + lwIP/iPXE/*BSD).

- **B0 — conn struct 80 → 128 B** (`net.cyr`). The 10-slot struct was full; stride grown to 16 slots, adding SND.UNA, SND.WND, `rx_read`, and reserved retransmit fields (seq/len/tick/count for B2). All existing offsets (0–72) preserved; new fields zeroed on every create path (active / passive-open / LISTEN). `tcp_conns` array already had room (5120 B).
- **B1 — in-order receive ring + honest window** (`net.cyr`). The per-conn buffer is now a 2048-byte ring: `tcp_rx_append` (free-clamped, power-of-two wrap) + `tcp_recv` (FIFO drain with wrap). The ESTABLISHED path accepts only in-order segments (`seq == RCV.NXT`), appends + advances RCV.NXT by accepted bytes, cumulative-ACKs; out-of-order / already-acked segments re-send the cumulative ACK so the peer retransmits the gap (no reassembly queue in v1). The advertised window is now the real ring free space (replacing the 8192/248 lie); `tcp_recv` emits a window-update ACK on drain so large streams keep flowing. Peer window captured into SND.WND (reserved for B4).
- **Validation** — new `scripts/tcp-smoke.sh` (`TCP_SELFTEST=1`): hermetic ring reassembly — FIFO order across appends + a forced buffer wrap, byte-exact (`tcp: ring PASS`). **No regression**: `tcp-listen-smoke.sh` now **2/2** (the full accept-one round-trip — handshake → accept → send → receive — passes; scenario 1 had been false-failing on a stale `1.32.0` version-string grep, now made version-agnostic). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 810,560 → **812,096 B**.
- **Remaining this cycle**: B3 MSS option + send segmentation, B4 honor peer SND.WND. Congestion control + RTT-estimated RTO deferred (audit § 7).

### Added — TCP hardening B2: retransmit + RTO/backoff

One-in-flight retransmit (iPXE-scale, audit § 4) — the reliability half of the cycle. A single unACKed segment (SYN / data / FIN) is held per-conn and resent when its RTO elapses, until the peer ACKs past it or the retry cap declares the conn dead. A lost SYN, request, or FIN now recovers instead of hanging → failing.

- **`net.cyr`** — `tcp_arm_retx` captures the held segment (seq + flags + payload, pinning SND.UNA); `tcp_retx_rto(count)` = 1 s base, ×2 per retry, capped ×16 (RFC 6298 backoff, fixed base — RTT estimation deferred); `tcp_retx_tick` (driven from `net_poll`) resends due segments and closes the conn after `TCP_RTO_RETRIES` (5) unACKed resends. Arm points: SYN (`tcp_connect`), SYN-ACK (passive open), data (`tcp_send`), FIN (`tcp_close`). An inbound ACK covering the held segment advances SND.UNA + disarms (with a wrapped-dup-ACK guard). `tcp_connect` now polls on an ~8 s timer deadline (was a fixed 200-iteration count) so SYN retransmits have time to recover.
- **Validation** — `tcp-smoke.sh` extended (`tcp: retx PASS`): hermetic checks of the RTO-backoff math, arm/disarm field plumbing, a force-due resend bumping the retry count, and the give-up → CLOSED path. `tcp-listen-smoke.sh` 2/2 (the passive-open handshake exercises arm-on-SYN-ACK + ACK-disarm — no regression). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 812,096 → **814,576 B**.
- **Remaining**: B4 honor peer SND.WND.

### Added — TCP hardening B3: MSS option + send segmentation

The SYN carried no MSS option (peers assumed the 536 default) and `tcp_send` emitted the caller's whole `len` as a single segment — a >MSS send produced an oversized, IP-fragmenting-or-dropped segment. B3 fixes both (audit § 4).

- **`net.cyr`** — SYN / SYN-ACK now carry the MSS option (RFC 9293 §3.2: kind 2, len 4, value `TCP_OUR_MSS` = 1460; data offset bumped to 6 words). `tcp_parse_mss` walks a received segment's options (NOP/EOL-aware) for the peer's MSS; `tcp_eff_mss` clamps it to ours and falls back to 536 when absent. The effective MSS is learned on the SYN-ACK (active open) and the incoming SYN (passive open), stored per-conn. `tcp_send` now **segments into ≤ effective-MSS chunks**, sending one at a time and waiting (bounded ~8 s) for each chunk's ACK before the next — keeping the B2 one-in-flight invariant so every segment is retransmit-protected. Struct grew 144 → 152 B for `eff_mss`.
- **Validation** — `tcp-smoke.sh` extended (`tcp: mss PASS`): hermetic option emit (byte-exact `02 04 05 B4`), parse (24-byte header → 1460; bare 20-byte header → absent), and the effective-MSS clamp/default/honor-smaller math. `tcp-listen-smoke.sh` 2/2 — the handshake now exchanges MSS options and the banner ships via the new segmenting blocking `tcp_send`, no regression. `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 814,576 → **816,320 B**.

### Added — TCP hardening B4: honor peer SND.WND (closes the arc)

Send-side flow control — `tcp_send` never pushes more than the peer can hold. Completes the TCP-hardening arc.

- **`net.cyr`** — the peer's advertised window is now captured from **every** inbound segment at the top of `net_handle_tcp` (was only the ESTABLISHED data path — so the SYN-ACK's initial window was missed, which would have read as 0 and stalled the first send). `tcp_send_chunk(remaining, mss, wnd)` sizes each segment as `min(remaining, MSS, window)`, and on a **zero window** returns 1 — the RFC 9293 §3.8.6.1 single-byte persist probe, which B2's retransmit timer naturally re-probes until the peer reopens the window. Congestion control (cwnd / slow-start) remains deferred (audit § 7).
- **Validation** — `tcp-smoke.sh` extended (`tcp: wnd PASS`): hermetic `tcp_send_chunk` sizing (remaining-bound / MSS-bound / window-bound / zero-window-persist). `tcp-listen-smoke.sh` 2/2 — the full 30-byte banner ships, which now depends on the window being captured non-zero from the handshake (a broken capture would persist-probe 1 byte and fail the banner check). `test.sh` 4/4, `check.sh` 11/11. Production build 816,320 → **816,544 B**.

**1.35.1 TCP hardening is feature-complete** (B0 struct → B1 in-order ring → B2 retransmit → B3 MSS/segmentation → B4 peer-window). The minimal SYN/ACK/FIN machine is now a reliable, flow-controlled byte stream — the `ark`/`nous`-fetch enabler. Deferred to a follow-on (audit § 7): congestion control, RTT-estimated RTO, SACK, TIME_WAIT, multi-segment send pipelining. Next comms: **NTP/SNTP**.

## [1.35.0] — 2026-05-27 (the **catchup-tidbits cycle** — a full agnos documentation sweep (after the 1.34.x FAT-family arc) plus the cycle's first two networking-comms bites: **DNS stub resolver** + **ICMP echo / ping**. Opened lean 2026-05-26 (VERSION 1.34.6 → 1.35.0); bites landed 2026-05-26→27. Legacy virtio-net was back-burnered (known TX-handler gap, covered by the modern driver). The networking-comms continuation — TCP hardening, then NTP — moves to 1.35.1+; TLS stays with the cyrius agent.)

### Added — DNS stub resolver (1.35.x catchup, first code bite)

A minimal RFC 1035 stub resolver — turn a hostname into an IPv4 by asking the configured recursive resolver over UDP/53. The precondition for name-based networking (`ark`/`nous` fetch, `hoosh` gateway hostnames) and the substrate for the `dig` userland tool. Audit-doc-first per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]]: [`dns-stub-resolver-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/dns-stub-resolver-prior-art.md) (RFC 1035/3596 + musl `res_*` + lwIP/iPXE `dns.c` + Plan 9 `ndb/dns`). Built on the existing UDP transport (the 1.32.x DHCP work already shipped `udp_bind`/`udp_recv_from` + the ingress demux) — no new transport code.

- **Bite 1 — DHCP option 6 capture** (`net.cyr`). The DISCOVER param-list already requested option 6 (DNS server), but the ACK handler dropped it. Now captured into a new `net_dns_server` global (mirrors `net_gateway`), with a gateway fallback when the lease omits it. Boot prints `dhcp: ACK … dns=<ip>`.
- **Bite 2 — RFC 1035 query/parse** (`net.cyr`): `dns_qname_encode` (length-prefixed labels), `dns_build_query` (header + question, RD=1, QTYPE=A/QCLASS=IN), `dns_skip_name` (handles `0xC0` compression pointers — skip-not-decompress, per lwIP/iPXE), `dns_parse_answer` (ID/QR/RCODE validation + answer walk → first A record), `dns_resolve(host, len, out_ip)` (fixed ephemeral source port, lazy single bind, one midpoint retransmit, bounded poll). Resolver precedence: DHCP opt 6 → gateway → `1.1.1.1`. A `dns <hostname>` shell verb prints the dotted-quad (the `dig` substrate). Stub scope only — no cache, no TCP fallback, no EDNS0, no AAAA (deferred; see audit § 8).
- **Validation** — new `scripts/dns-smoke.sh` (`DNS_SELFTEST=1` boot-hook + QEMU/SLIRP). Both hermetic gates pass: a hand-built compression-pointer response parses back to `93.184.216.34` (`dns: parse PASS`), and DHCP option 6 is captured under SLIRP (`dns: resolver=10.0.2.3`). The live path also resolved end-to-end through SLIRP→host DNS (`example.com → 172.66.147.243`). No iron burn required — DNS rides the iron-COMPLETE 1.32.9 r8169/DHCP path; an opportunistic iron confirm can ride a future burn.

### Added — ICMP echo / ping (1.35.x catchup, second code bite)

ICMP (RFC 792) — the kernel had no ICMP at all (proto 1 was unhandled in the IP demux). Adds echo in both directions plus basic error awareness, and a `ping` shell verb (the diagnostic pair with the DNS bite's `dns`). ICMP echo is identical across every stack, so the prior art is cited inline (RFC 792) rather than in a standalone doc.

- **`net.cyr`** — `net_handle_icmp` wired into `net_poll`'s IP demux at `ip_proto == 1`: type 8 (echo request) → `icmp_send_echo_reply` (AGNOS is now **pingable**, id/seq/payload echoed verbatim); type 0 (echo reply) → matched against the outstanding `icmp_id`; types 3/11 (dest-unreachable / time-exceeded) logged. `icmp_ping(dst_ip)` builds an echo request (8-byte header + 32-byte payload), sends it, and waits (bounded ~3 s) for the matching reply, returning elapsed `timer_ticks`. The ICMP checksum reuses `ip_checksum` directly (no pseudo-header).
- **`shell.cyr`** — `ping <host>` verb: parses a dotted-quad via the new `sh_parse_ipv4` helper, else falls back to `dns_resolve` (so `ping example.com` works off the DNS bite). Prints the target + reply/timeout.
- **Validation** — new `scripts/icmp-smoke.sh` (`ICMP_SELFTEST=1` + QEMU/SLIRP). Hermetic gate passes: a built echo request re-checksums to 0 (`icmp: build PASS`). The live path also worked — gateway echo round-tripped through SLIRP (`icmp: gw reply ticks=0`). No iron burn required (rides the iron-COMPLETE 1.32.9 path).
- **Build/test** — production build 798,936 → **810,560 B** across the two bites. `test.sh` 4/4 + `check.sh` 11/11 after bumping their binary-size sanity ceilings (`test.sh` 800 K and `check.sh`'s stale 350 K — red since the 1.31.x storage arc — both → 1.2 M).

### Changed — full documentation sweep (`README.md`, `docs/development/state.md`, `docs/development/roadmap.md`, `docs/architecture/overview.md`, `docs/development/build.md`, `docs/development/syscall-additions.md`, `docs/development/kybernet-bridge.md`, `docs/doc-health.md`)

The README + per-tree docs had drifted to the v1.30.x / 1.31.1 MVP-gate-and-storage era (pre the 1.32.x networking, 1.33.x ext2/4-write, and 1.34.x FAT-family arcs). Swept to current 1.35.0 state:

- **`README.md`** — capability picture (storage stack, networking, the ext2/4 + full FAT-family filesystem stack), subsystem table (40+) with corrected xHCI/FAT rows, shell-command count, file counts, size comparison.
- **`state.md`** — body brought forward from its frozen 1.31.1 shape: Build artifacts (475 KB → 798,936 B; cyrius 5.11.59 → 6.0.1), source rollup (66 → 71 files, core 22 → 26, usb 8 → 9), subsystem table (added r8169 / DHCP / USB-MS / RAM-disk / ext2-4 / FAT-family / exFAT / FS-write guard rows; per-cut size-trajectory log trimmed to a CHANGELOG pointer), In-flight + Recently-closed sections.
- **`roadmap.md`** — **restructured to be forward-facing**: the completed "Shipped" arc ledger, the 1.30.x recap, all ✅-closed rows, and the completed Security-Hardening / Multi-Architecture / Planned tables were removed (their history lives in this CHANGELOG); only active / slotted-future / deferred items + the platform decade map + the cyrius-PIE-gated KASLR track remain.
- **`architecture/overview.md`** — 35+ → 40+ subsystems, cyrius pin, boot sequence + subsystem diagram + Block-I/O / Networking prose updated for the storage / networking / read+write-FS stacks; "FAT16 read-only" retired.
- **`build.md`** — compile-gate flag table completed: was current through the storage arc (`AHCI_RW_DEMO` / `MSC_RW_DEMO` / `RAMDISK_ENABLE`), added the 7 networking/FS gates accreted since (`NET_VERBOSE`, `EXT2_WRITE_SELFTEST`, `FATFS_SELFTEST`, `FATFS_WRITE_SELFTEST`, `EXFAT_SELFTEST`, `EXFAT_WRITE_SELFTEST`, `FAT_ALLOW_ESP_WRITE`) + enabling examples. All 13 `scripts/build.sh` gates now documented.
- **`syscall-additions.md` / `kybernet-bridge.md`** — header refresh; surface/design confirmed unchanged since v1.21.0 (26-call surface; the write arcs reuse `open`/`write`/`mkdir`/`mount`/`sync`).
- **`doc-health.md`** — currency ledger refreshed for the 1.35.0 sweep.

## [1.34.6] — 2026-05-26 (**ESP-write safety guard** — the 1.34.x arc cap (code half). FAT/exFAT refuse writes to an ESP-type GPT partition so the boot ESP can't be clobbered, before the FAT-family arc's first iron burn. QEMU-validated (fires / override / no-false-block); the user-driven iron burn is the only remaining 1.34.x item.)

### Added — ESP-write safety guard (1.34.x arc cap) (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/exfat.cyr`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

Before the FAT-family arc's first iron burn: AGNOS now refuses FAT/exFAT **writes** to an ESP-type GPT partition — the boot ESP (gnoboot's `BOOTX64.EFI` + the kernel) is firmware/boot territory; data writes belong on a Microsoft-Basic-Data partition or a removable USB stick. `fatfs`/`exfat` record `fat_on_esp`/`exfat_on_esp` at mount (the matched partition's type GUID is ESP vs MSFT-Basic; whole-disk = writable), and the single write chokepoint `fat_blk_write`/`exfat_blk_write` refuses when on the ESP, so a write self-test or a write bug can't touch the boot files. `FAT_ALLOW_ESP_WRITE` (build flag) overrides it for the QEMU `fat-write-smoke`, whose ESP is a throwaway test image. (`boot_info` carries no boot-device field, so the guard keys off the ESP partition-type GUID, not "the partition we booted from.")

QEMU-validated 3 ways: **(A) fires** — write self-test with no override on the ESP → `create rc=-1`, `BOOTX64.EFI` intact, no test file written, `fsck.fat` clean; **(B) override** — `FAT_ALLOW_ESP_WRITE` → ESP writes work; **(C) no false-block** — exFAT on a MSFT-Basic partition (no override) → writes work, `fsck.exfat` clean. Completes the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation's arc cap; the user-driven FAT/exFAT iron burn (plan in `iron-nuc-zen-log.md` `#tracker-1341-cycle`) is the only remaining 1.34.x item.

## [1.34.5] — 2026-05-26 (**exFAT Unicode names** — the final cut of the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation (roadmap row 21): the volume's **up-case table** now drives the NameHash + case-fold compare, so non-ASCII names round-trip correctly instead of ASCII-upcase. QEMU/`fsck.exfat`-validated; no iron burn (the arc-cap FAT/exFAT iron burn is the only remaining 1.34.x item, user-driven).)

### Added — exFAT Unicode names: real up-case table for NameHash + case-fold (`core/exfat.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/exfat-write-smoke.sh`)

exFAT name handling used ASCII upcase, so a non-ASCII name got the wrong NameHash (fsck-flagged) and case-folded wrong. Now the volume's **up-case table** drives both:

- **`exfat_load_upcase`** loads the `0x82` system file (already located at mount) into an 8 KB buffer via its FAT chain (the standard mkfs table is 5836 B; a larger table falls back to ASCII upcase).
- **`exfat_upcase`** maps a UTF-16 code unit through the RLE-compressed table (a `0xFFFF` marker + count means an identity run; any other entry is the explicit mapping). Verified against a real `mkfs.exfat` table (`a→A`, `é→É` U+00E9→U+00C9, `ÿ→Ÿ` U+00FF→U+0178 — the up-cased unit can exceed one byte, which is why the NameHash hashes both halves). Loaded at mount after the system-file locate.
- `exfat_name_hash` (write) + `exfat_name_eq` (read/match) now use `exfat_upcase` instead of ASCII upcase.

**Verification** — build 788,696 → **798,648 B**; `exfat-write-smoke.sh` creates `Café.txt` (byte `0xE9`) → `fsck.exfat -n` **clean** (fsck recomputes the NameHash with the volume up-case table and it matches — the discriminating oracle; ASCII upcase would leave `0xE9` → "name hash mismatch"/corrupted), plus find-by-non-ASCII-name + content readback. All prior exFAT/FAT/ext2 gates green, `test.sh` 4/4. The 1.34.x write-completeness continuation (1.34.2–1.34.5) is **feature-complete**; only the arc cap remains (ESP-write safety guard + the user-driven FAT/exFAT iron burn).

## [1.34.4] — 2026-05-26 (**directory growth — root extension + cross-boundary dir-set append (exFAT + FAT)** — third cut of the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation (roadmap row 21). Both filesystems gain a **spanning append**: a dir-set starts at the first `0x00` and streams across sector/cluster boundaries, extending the FAT-chained root by fresh zeroed clusters — clearing the single-cluster-root ceiling that blocked multi-file creates. QEMU/`fsck`-validated; no iron burn (final-bite only).)

### Added — directory growth: root extension + cross-boundary dir-set append, exFAT + FAT (`core/exfat.cyr`, `core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/{exfat,fat}-write-smoke.sh`)

Third cut of the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation. Both filesystems previously placed each dir-set within a single sector and refused once the root filled (the ceiling that forced 1.34.2's overwrite/truncate tests to run in place). Same fix on both: a **spanning append** — a set starts at the first `0x00` (end-of-directory) and streams contiguously across sector/cluster boundaries, extending the (FAT-chained) root by fresh zeroed clusters as needed. The previous one-sector-fit placement could strand a `0x00` before live entries → fsck "0x85/entry follows unused entry" (the exFAT smoke caught this). Build 783,240 → **788,696 B**.

**exFAT** (`core/exfat.cyr`):

- **`exfat_fat_set`** — write a 32-bit exFAT FAT entry (the root directory is FAT-chained, unlike NoFatChain data files).
- **`exfat_root_cluster_for_index`** — map a linear root-dir entry index to its cluster, **extending** the root by fresh zeroed clusters (alloc from the bitmap + link prev→new→EOC in the FAT) as the index requires.
- **`exfat_dir_append_set`** — append a fully-built set at the root's first `0x00` (end-of-directory), streaming the entries **contiguously across sector/cluster boundaries** (per-entry RMW) and extending the root as the run + trailing `0x00` need. This replaces the one-sector-fit placement, which could strand a `0x00` before live entries → `fsck.exfat` "0x85 follows unused entry" (caught by the smoke). `exfat_emit_set` now builds the set into a 640-B scratch (so the SetChecksum covers the whole set) then appends it.

This unifies exFAT's two 1.34.4 items — **root extension** and **cross-sector dir-set** — into one mechanism, and re-enables the deferred multi-new-file create path. Validated: `exfat-write-smoke.sh` creates 10 new files (`EXN0.BIN`..`EXN9.BIN`, 30 dir entries) past the 16-entry root → `fsck.exfat -n` **clean, files 13** + extended-root file reads back byte-exact.

**FAT** (`core/fatfs.cyr`): the same mechanism — **`fat_root_extend`** (FAT32 only: alloc + link + zero a cluster), **`fat_root_cluster_for_index`** (extend the FAT32 root chain to a linear index), **`fat_dir_end_index`**, and **`fat_dir_append_set`** (append a built set at the first `0x00`, spanning sector/cluster boundaries + extending the FAT32 root; the FAT12/16 fixed root stays bounded by RootEntryCount). `fatfs_create_lfn` + `fatfs_write_file_lfn` now build the LFN set into a shared scratch (`fatfs_build_lfn_set`) then append it — so an LFN set straddling a sector lands correctly and the root grows past its pre-allocated clusters. `fatfs_find_free_root_slot` (8.3) extends the FAT32 root when 100%-full. Validated: `fat-write-smoke.sh` creates 40 LFN-named files (`LfNN_longx.dat`, 120 dir entries, distinct `~N` alias bases) past the 16-entry FAT32 root cluster → `fsck.fat -n` clean, all 40 long names reconstruct (count=40), extended-root readback byte-exact.

**Verification** — build 783,240 → **788,696 B**; `test.sh` 4/4; both write smokes + ext2 green. The 1.34.4 cut is **feature-complete**. Deleted-slot reuse is deferred (directories grow append-only; deleted entries stay as fsck-valid holes).

## [1.34.3] — 2026-05-26 (**FAT LFN/truncate completeness** — second cut of the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation (roadmap row 21): LFN-with-content, LFN-name overwrite-match (the first LFN *read* in the driver), and grow-truncate. FAT-only — exFAT is UTF-16-native, no LFN. QEMU/`fsck.fat`-validated; no iron burn (final-bite only).)

### Added — FAT LFN/truncate completeness (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

All three items QEMU-validated via `fat-write-smoke.sh` (`fsck.fat -n` clean throughout, no regression to the existing FAT write gates); build 772,568 → **783,240 B**.

- **bite 1 — LFN-with-content**: new **`fatfs_write_file_lfn`** creates a long-named file carrying content — 8.3-fitting names fall through to `fatfs_write_file`; otherwise it allocates + writes the cluster chain first (data-before-dirent crash ordering), then writes the LFN set with the **8.3-alias entry pointing at the first cluster + carrying FileSize** (the released `fatfs_create_lfn` left the alias at cluster 0 / size 0). `LongContent12345.bin` (3000 B) reads back byte-exact through its long name.
- **bite 2 — LFN-name overwrite-match**: new **`fatfs_find_lfn`** does the first LFN *read* — it reassembles long names from their reverse-ordered `0x0F` entry runs (13 UTF-16 chars each, terminator-aware) and matches the query against the LONG name OR the 8.3 short name, recording the 8.3 entry's location. `fatfs_write_file_lfn` now uses it to **overwrite an existing long-named file in place** (repoint cluster + size, free the old chain; the 8.3 alias + LFN entries are preserved so the LFN checksum stays valid) instead of creating a duplicate under a fresh `~N` alias. `LfnOver12345.bin` written 3000 B then overwritten 2000 B by its long name → a *single* dir entry, content byte-exact.
- **bite 3 — grow-truncate**: `fatfs_truncate` was shrink-only; it now also **grows** a file to `newlen` with the grown region reading as zeros — it zero-fills the old last cluster's slack, allocates + zero-fills the new clusters, links them onto the chain, then publishes the new size last (a crash leaves a chain longer than the dirent size, fsck-fixable, never a live dirent → garbage cluster; ENOSPC rolls back). Handles growth from empty (sets the first cluster) + growth within the existing last cluster. `GROW.BIN` written 1000 B then grown to 3000 B → `[0,1000)` data + `[1000,3000)` zeros.

**The 1.34.3 cut is feature-complete** — delete-by-long-name (clear the LFN run; `fatfs_find_lfn` already locates the set) is a noted follow-on.

## [1.34.2] — 2026-05-26 (**exFAT write parity** — first cut of the 1.34.x write-completeness continuation (agnos roadmap row 21), bringing exFAT up to FAT's bite-3e level: overwrite-existing, arbitrary-length truncate, PercentInUse maintenance, ENOSPC rollback. The non-verb carry-forwards from the 1.34.0 (FAT) + 1.34.1 (exFAT) minor are landing as 4 themed in-arc cuts (1.34.2–1.34.5); shell verbs stay deferred to the 1.39.x VFS generic-write lift. QEMU/`fsck.exfat`-validated; no iron burn (final-bite only).)

### Added — exFAT write parity (`core/exfat.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/exfat-write-smoke.sh`)

Brings exFAT up to FAT's bite-3e level. QEMU/`fsck.exfat`-validated.

- **overwrite-existing** — `exfat_write_file` no longer refuses an existing name: it allocates + writes the new data, then repoints the existing dir-set in place (`exfat_set_update_alloc` rewrites the `0xC0` Stream-Extension's flags/`ValidDataLength`/`FirstCluster`/`DataLength` + recomputes the SetChecksum) and frees the old clusters **after** repointing — so a crash before the repoint leaves the old file intact + leaked new clusters, never a dangling pointer.
- **arbitrary-length truncate** — new `exfat_truncate(name, newlen)` (shrink only; grow refused): shrinks `DataLength`/`ValidDataLength` + recomputes the SetChecksum first, then frees the orphaned tail clusters (contiguous `NoFatChain`; chained-file tail-free is a follow-on). `exfat_truncate_zero` remains for the newlen==0 case.
- **PercentInUse maintenance** — `exfat_update_percent_in_use` popcounts the allocation bitmap (sequential, not per-bit) and writes `PercentInUse`@112 to the main (sector 0) + backup (sector 12) boot sectors. Offset 112 is **excluded from the boot-region checksum**, so this is the one boot-region field a writer may touch without a checksum recompute (`fsck.exfat -n` stays clean, confirming the boot region is intact). VolumeDirty (`VolumeFlags`@106) is left clean — AGNOS completes each mutation synchronously + fsck-clean, with no dirty/clean transaction model (the ext2 `s_state` analogue, deferred with journaling). Wired into write/overwrite/delete/truncate.
- **ENOSPC rollback** — `exfat_alloc_contiguous` returns 0 before setting any bitmap bits when no run fits, so `exfat_write_file` returns -1 having published nothing — no partial file, no leaked bits.

**Verification** — build 768,024 → **772,568 B**; `scripts/exfat-write-smoke.sh` extended: overwrite EXDATA.BIN 3000→2000 byte-exact, arbitrary truncate 2000→1000, ENOSPC (100 MB request on a 67 MB volume) → rc≠0 + file absent, all with `fsck.exfat -n` **clean, files 3**. (Overwrite/truncate run in place on an existing file — root-directory extension for *new*-file creates past the single-cluster root's 16 entries is the 1.34.4 cross-boundary cut.) `test.sh` 4/4; ext2 + FAT smokes green. **Remaining 1.34.x continuation:** 1.34.3 FAT LFN/truncate completeness, 1.34.4 cross-boundary dir runs (incl. root extension + deleted-slot reuse), 1.34.5 exFAT Unicode names; arc cap = ESP-write guard + user-driven iron burn.

## [1.34.1] — 2026-05-26 (**exFAT** — the FAT-family sibling, split out of 1.34.0 per the 2026-05-26 FS-scope decision (finish FAT12/16/32 fully in 1.34.0, exFAT as its own cut). exFAT is structurally **its own filesystem**, not "FAT with bigger numbers": a 12-sector boot region (Main + Backup) with an `"EXFAT   "` signature + a VBR checksum sector, an **allocation bitmap** (1 bit/cluster — not a FAT free-scan), an **upcase table** for case-insensitive Unicode compare, a FAT used **only for fragmented chains** (contiguous files set `NoFatChain`), and 32-byte **typed directory records** — a file is a *set*: one `0x85` File entry (attrs/timestamps/`SecondaryCount`/**SetChecksum**) + one `0xC0` Stream-Extension (name length/hash, `FirstCluster`, `DataLength`, `NoFatChain`) + ⌈NameLen/15⌉ `0xC1` File-Name entries (UTF-16; no 8.3/LFN). Near-zero shared code with `fatfs`, so it lands as a **new `kernel/core/exfat.cyr`** module with its own MSFT-Basic-Data partition probe (the `fatfs` probe rejects exFAT — its `BytsPerSec`@11 is zero). **Read-first then write**, mirroring the ext2/FAT arcs. **Lean cycle-open** — VERSION 1.34.0 → 1.34.1, this header, tracking surface; no code bites yet. Multi-source audit first per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]] (Microsoft exFAT spec + Linux `fs/exfat` + `exfatprogs`); **`mkfs.exfat`/`fsck.exfat` (exfatprogs) as the host-side oracle**, the exFAT analogue of `e2fsck`/`fsck.fat`. Each bite a QEMU smoke gate; **NO iron burn until the final bite**, per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. Bite plan + falsification rubric: [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1341-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1341-cycle).)

### Added — bite 2: exFAT mount + read (`core/exfat.cyr`, `core/agnos.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/exfat-smoke.sh`)

New `kernel/core/exfat.cyr` — a FAT-family **sibling** module (near-zero shared code with `fatfs`), read path per [`exfat-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/exfat-prior-art.md) § 1–4. QEMU-validated; no iron burn (final bite only).

- **Mount** — `exfat_init` mirrors `fatfs_init`/`ext2_init`: probe every registered backend (whole-disk first, then the GPT **ESP / Microsoft-Basic-Data** partitions on `blk_active`), all reads routed through **`exfat_blk_read`** = `blk_read_on(exfat_backend, exfat_partition_first_lba + sector)`. `exfat_parse_boot` reads the boot region — `"EXFAT   "`@3 signature, `BytesPerSectorShift`@108 (512-only, 1:1 with the block layer), `SectorsPerClusterShift`@109, `FatOffset`@80, `ClusterHeapOffset`@88, `ClusterCount`@92, `FirstClusterOfRootDirectory`@96, `NumberOfFats`@110. `fatfs` already self-excludes exFAT (`BytsPerSec`@11 = 0), so the two coexist (FAT32 ESP + exFAT MSFT-Basic on one disk). Wired into `main.cyr` after `fatfs_init()`.
- **FAT-chain traversal** — **`exfat_next_cluster`** reads the 32-bit FAT entry (EOC `0xFFFFFFFF` / bad `0xFFFFFFF7` → 0) with a one-sector FAT cache; **`exfat_cluster_sector`** = `ClusterHeapOffset + (c-2)*spc`.
- **Typed dir-set walk** — `exfat_locate_system_files` records the `0x81` Allocation Bitmap + `0x82` Up-case Table (FirstCluster/DataLength + the upcase `TableChecksum`) from the root. `exfat_find` consumes the root as one ordered entry stream with a small set-collection state machine, so a `0x85` File + `0xC0` Stream-Extension (`NameLength`/`FirstCluster`/`DataLength`/`NoFatChain` flag) + N `0xC1` File-Name (15 UTF-16 chars) **set that straddles a sector/cluster boundary** reconstructs correctly; ASCII case-insensitive name match. `exfat_ls` counts in-use File entries.
- **Cluster read** — **`exfat_read`** reads `DataLength` bytes from `FirstCluster`, **contiguous** (`NoFatChain`=1, step c+1) **or via the FAT chain**, into the caller's buffer (capped one page in `exfat_open`→`vfs_create_memfile`, mirroring `fatfs_open`; shell `cat` wiring deferred to the 1.39.x VFS lift).

**Verification** — production build 740,272 → **759,256 B**; new **`scripts/exfat-smoke.sh`** (+ `EXFAT_SELFTEST` build flag) boots against a GPT disk (FAT32 ESP boot path + a `mkfs.exfat -c 512` Microsoft-Basic-Data p2). exFAT has no `mtools`-equivalent and the box has no non-interactive root/fuse, so instead of seeding a file the smoke validates the read substrate against the structures `mkfs.exfat` writes into an **empty** volume: gates **`exfat: mounted backend=2 partition_lba=67584 spc=1 root_clus=47`** (boot-region parse + MSFT-Basic probe + bitmap/upcase locate) + **`exfatu: upcase-checksum OK`** — the 5836-byte up-case table read back over its **multi-cluster FAT chain** reproduces the `TableChecksum` `mkfs.exfat` baked into the `0x82` entry (an INDEPENDENT chain-read oracle); `fsck.exfat -n` confirms the volume clean (reads don't mutate). The **`0x85`/`0xC0`/`0xC1` file-set read** (name reconstruction + `NoFatChain`/chain data read) was implemented compile-clean then validated end-to-end (`exfatr: file-read OK`) once a `mount -t exfat`-seeded `EXFTEST.BIN` was present — `got=3000 nfc=1`, byte-exact. **Read only**; exFAT **write** is bite 3.

### Added — bite 3: exFAT write — create / content / delete / truncate (`core/exfat.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/exfat-write-smoke.sh`)

The exFAT write path per [`exfat-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/exfat-prior-art.md) § 2–4. The bug-prone 16-bit checksum algorithms were verified independently first (a Python-injected dir-set blessed by `fsck.exfat`) before the Cyrius port. QEMU-validated; no iron burn.

- **3a — dir-set create** — `exfat_emit_set` writes a file's typed set into a free root run: `0x85` File (`SecondaryCount` + **SetChecksum** + ARCHIVE attr) + `0xC0` Stream-Extension (flags + `NameLength` + **NameHash** + `ValidDataLength`/`FirstCluster`/`DataLength`) + ⌈namelen/15⌉ `0xC1` File-Name (UTF-16). **SetChecksum** + **NameHash** = the shared 16-bit rotate-right-and-add `exfat_csum16` (SetChecksum over the set skipping the 0x85's own bytes 2–3; NameHash over the ASCII-upcased UTF-16 name). `exfat_find_free_dir_run` finds a contiguous run of `0x00` slots (the entry after stays `0x00`, preserving the end-of-directory marker). `exfat_create` = empty file (no clusters). `exfat_blk_write` = `blk_write_on(exfat_backend, …)`.
- **3b — content write** — allocation-bitmap allocator: `exfat_bitmap_get`/`exfat_bitmap_set` address a cluster's bit (LSB-first) **through the bitmap file's own cluster chain** (`exfat_bitmap_load_byte`, cached in a dedicated `exfat_bmp_buf`); `exfat_alloc_contiguous` free-run-scans for N consecutive clusters. `exfat_write_file` allocates a contiguous run, writes the data (zero-padding the final cluster's slack), **then** publishes the dir-set with `FirstCluster`/`DataLength` + flags `AllocationPossible|NoFatChain` (=0x03) — data-before-dirent ordering, so a crash leaks bitmap bits (fsck-fixable) rather than cross-linking.
- **3c — delete + truncate-to-zero** — `exfat_find` now records the matched set's location (sector/slot/count). `exfat_delete` clears the InUse bit (0x80) on every entry of the set (`0x85→0x05`, `0xC0→0x40`, `0xC1→0x41`) **then** frees the clusters; `exfat_truncate_zero` zeroes the `0xC0` allocation fields (`AllocationPossible`/`ValidDataLength`/`FirstCluster`/`DataLength`) + recomputes the SetChecksum, **then** frees. `exfat_free_clusters` clears the bitmap bits (contiguous run for `NoFatChain`, else the FAT chain). One-sector sets (cross-sector = follow-on).

**Verification** — production build 759,256 → **768,024 B**; new **`scripts/exfat-write-smoke.sh`** (+ `EXFAT_WRITE_SELFTEST` flag) boots the kernel against a fresh `mkfs.exfat -c 512` volume, AGNOS performs the mutations, and the smoke extracts the post-boot partition out of the image for **`fsck.exfat -n` → clean, directories 1, files 3** (the independent structure + SetChecksum/NameHash oracle, exFAT analogue of `fsck.fat -n`). Gates: 3a `create rc=0` + `find-back OK`; 3b `write rc=0` + multi-cluster (3000 B / 6 clusters, `nfc=1`) **round-trip byte-exact** via AGNOS's own `exfat_read`; 3c `delete` + `truncate-to-zero` both rc=0 with **no leaked/cross-linked cluster** (fsck-clean after freeing). `PercentInUse` left stale (fsck tolerates it). No regression (`test.sh` 4/4, ext2 + FAT smokes green). Follow-ons: overwrite-existing, arbitrary-length truncate, cross-sector dir-set, LFN-N/A (exFAT is UTF-16-native), non-ASCII names (real up-case table), `PercentInUse`/VolumeDirty maintenance, shell verbs (1.39.x VFS lift).

## [1.34.0] — 2026-05-26 (opens the **additional-filesystems arc** (roadmap row 21) — theme **FAT-family**: **FAT write** first, then **exFAT**. The 1.33.x ext2/ext4 WRITE patch line is closed; this arc fills the gap before the 1.37.x+ big-write own-cycles. **FAT write** extends the read-only `fatfs` (FAT12/16/32) with mutation — FAT-chain cluster allocation + FAT-table writes (both copies), directory-entry create/delete (8.3 + LFN), file write/truncate/append, free-cluster accounting (FAT32 `FSINFO`). It is strategically the keystone of this arc: the **first *second* writable filesystem**, which becomes the concrete trigger for the **1.39.x VFS generic-write lift** (`ext2_*`→`vfs_*`, abstract-on-demand per the `block.cyr` dispatch precedent — two writable FSes is when the abstraction earns itself). Iron-validatable directly: the ESP and commodity USB sticks are already FAT. **exFAT** follows as the large-removable-media successor — structurally its own thing (allocation **bitmap** + 32-byte **typed directory records** + upcase table; the FAT is used only for fragmented chains), so it lands read-first then write. **NTFS read + squashfs read deferred** to a later read-only slot (roadmap row 23) per the FS-choice decision. **Lean cycle-open** — VERSION 1.33.5 → 1.34.0, this header, tracking surface; no code bites yet. Multi-source audit first per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]] (Microsoft FAT spec / EFI FAT32 SPG + the exFAT spec + FreeBSD `msdosfs`/`newfs_msdos` + Linux `fs/fat` & `fs/exfat` + ECMA; `fsck.fat`/`mtools` and `exfatprogs` as the host-side oracle, the FAT-family analogue of `e2fsck` for the ext2 arc); each bite a QEMU smoke gate; **NO iron burn until the final bite**, per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. Bite plan + falsification rubric: [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1340-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1340-cycle).)

### Added — bite 2: FAT read parity — partition-aware multi-backend mount + FAT32 + cluster-chain traversal (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/fat-smoke.sh`)

Matures the toy FAT16-RO reader into a real read driver, closing audit gaps 1–4 (the precondition for FAT write). Per [`fat-family-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/fat-family-prior-art.md) § 5.

- **Partition-aware, multi-backend mount** — `fatfs_init` is no longer wired inside the VirtIO-blk branch (gap 1: it never ran on NVMe/AHCI/USB-MS iron). It now mirrors `ext2_init`: a `fat_backend` + `fat_partition_first_lba` probe over all registered backends, with every read routed through a new **`fat_blk_read`** = `blk_read_on(fat_backend, fat_partition_first_lba + sector)` (gap 2: was whole-disk absolute LBA 0). Tries whole-disk FAT first, then the GPT **ESP / Microsoft-Basic-Data** partitions (where FAT lives — not Linux-FS). Lifted to a standalone `fatfs_init()` call in `main.cyr` after the storage backends register + GPT parses.
- **FAT12/16/32** — `fatfs_parse_bpb` reads the FAT32 EBPB (`FATSz32`@36, `RootClus`@44) when `FATSz16`@22 is 0, and types the volume by the **`CountOfClus` test** (the only correct one per the MS spec: <4085 FAT12 / <65525 FAT16 / else FAT32) (gap 4: was FAT16-only fixed-root-region math). `fatfs_entry_cluster` now includes `FstClusHI`@20 for FAT32.
- **Cluster-chain traversal** — new **`fat_next_cluster`** reads the FAT entry (FAT12 1.5-byte packing incl. sector-straddle / FAT16 / FAT32 28-bit) with a one-sector FAT cache, and **`fatfs_first_sector_of_cluster`**. `fatfs_ls`, the new `fatfs_find_root`, and `fatfs_read` all **follow the chain** — `fatfs_read` reads a whole file across clusters into the caller's buffer (gap 3: the old reader read only the first cluster, ≤512 B). `fatfs_ls` and root search handle both the FAT12/16 fixed root region and the FAT32 root cluster chain.

**Verification** — production build 712,504 → **722,064 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5** + `ext2-write-smoke` W1–W5 **PASS** (no regression from the fatfs rewrite; on the same boot, `fat: mounted FAT32 backend=2 partition_lba=2048` confirms the partition-aware mount of the ESP on the NVMe backend). New **`scripts/fat-smoke.sh`** (+ `FATFS_SELFTEST` build flag) boots against a GPT disk whose FAT32 ESP is seeded with a 3000-byte multi-cluster `FATTEST.BIN` (`byte[i] = i & 0xFF`): gates **`fat: mounted FAT32`** + **`fatr: chain-read OK`** — the file reads back `got=3000` byte-exact at offsets 0/255/256/1000/2999, proving the chain-follow reads past the first 512-byte cluster. **Still read-only**; LFN reassembly (8.3 names work today), then the FAT **write** path (bite 3) and **exFAT** (bite 4) follow.

### Added — bite 3a: FAT write — empty-file create (the dirent-write primitive) (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

First slice of the FAT write path (bite 3). Isolates the dirent-write plumbing from the cluster-allocator complexity — same incremental discipline as the ext2 arc (W1 primitives before W4 dirent ops). An empty (zero-length) file has no clusters, so it's `fsck.fat`-clean on its own.

- **`fat_blk_write`** = `blk_write_on(fat_backend, fat_partition_first_lba + sector)` — the partition-relative write mirror of `fat_blk_read` (the 1.33.5 `blk_flush_on(fat_backend)` durability barrier is available to a future FAT `sync`).
- **`fatfs_build_83`** factored out of `fatfs_match_name` (shared 8.3 encoder for read-match + write-create; `match_name` now calls it).
- **`fatfs_create`** + **`fatfs_emit_dirent`** — refuse an existing name, find the first free slot (`0x00` end-of-dir / `0xE5` deleted) in the root (FAT32 cluster chain or FAT12/16 fixed region), and write an 8.3 dirent (attr=ARCHIVE, cluster 0, size 0) by read-modify-writing the dir sector. Root-extend (new dir cluster when the root is full) and LFN generation are follow-ons; 8.3 only.

**Verification** — production build 722,064 → **724,048 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; FAT read regression intact (`fat-smoke.sh` → `fatr: chain-read OK`, the `match_name`→`build_83` refactor didn't break read). New **`scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`** (+ `FATFS_WRITE_SELFTEST`) creates `NEWFILE.TXT` in the mounted FAT32 ESP (which holds the real gnoboot + agnos boot files) and gates: `fatw: create NEWFILE.TXT rc=0` + **`fsck.fat -n` clean** on the post-boot ESP (the new dirent didn't corrupt the FAT or the coexisting boot files — the stringent part) + `mdir` shows `NEWFILE.TXT` persisted. **Next (bite 3b): cluster allocator + content write** (find free cluster → mark EOC in all FAT copies → write data → update dirent cluster+size → maintain `FSINFO`), gated `fsck.fat -n`-clean + `mtype` reads back the content.

### Added — bite 3b: FAT write — cluster allocator + multi-cluster content write (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

The allocator half of FAT write. Audit § 2.3 / § 3.

- **FAT-entry I/O** — **`fat_get_entry`** (raw value: 0=free / EOC / next-cluster; distinct from `fat_next_cluster` which maps EOC→0, so the allocator can spot a free entry) + **`fat_set_entry`** (writes the entry to **all** `fatfs_num_fats` copies via per-copy read-modify-write; FAT32 preserves the top-4 reserved bits) + **`fat_eoc`**. **FAT12 write is refused** (`fat_set_entry` returns -1) — no realistic AGNOS target is FAT12 and its nibble-packed RMW isn't worth the risk; FAT12 *reads* still work.
- **`fat_alloc_cluster`** — linear free-cluster scan from cluster 2, marks the found cluster EOC in all FAT copies.
- **`fat_fsinfo_mark_unknown`** — parses the FAT32 `FSInfo` sector (`BPB_FSInfo`@48) and sets `Free_Count`/`Nxt_Free` to `0xFFFFFFFF` (spec "unknown") after a write — cheaper and safer than recomputing, and it keeps `fsck.fat -n` from flagging a stale free-count mismatch.
- **`fatfs_write_file`** — allocates a cluster chain (`alloc` → link `prev`→`cur` → the last stays EOC), writes the data sector-by-sector (zero-padding the final sector's slack), then publishes the 8.3 dirent with first-cluster + true size, then marks FSInfo unknown. **Ordered** per § 3: clusters are allocated + linked + written *before* the dirent is published, so a crash leaves at worst leaked clusters (fsck-reclaimable), never a live dirent pointing at a free chain. ENOSPC rollback + overwrite-existing are follow-ons. `fatfs_create` (3a) refactored onto the shared **`fatfs_find_free_root_slot`** + the generalized **`fatfs_emit_dirent`** (now carries cluster + size; self-contained — re-reads the slot sector, so it's safe after the intervening FAT/data IO).

**Verification** — production build 724,048 → **729,232 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; FAT read regression intact (`fat-smoke.sh` → `chain-read OK`). `fat-write-smoke.sh` extended: the self-test writes a 3000-byte multi-cluster `WTEST.BIN` (`byte[i] = i & 0xFF`, ~6 clusters at 512 B/clus) and the harness gates `fatw: write WTEST.BIN rc=0` + **`fsck.fat -n` clean** (FAT chains + dirents + coexisting boot files all consistent) + **`mtype` reads `WTEST.BIN` back byte-exact** vs the host pattern (`cmp`). **Next (bite 3c): truncate / delete** (free the chain + dirent `0xE5`), then **3d: LFN write + shell verbs**.

### Added — bite 3c: FAT write — delete (unlink) + truncate-to-zero (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

The free side of the mutation set. Audit § 3 (inverse ordering).

- **`fat_free_chain`** — walks a cluster chain, setting each FAT entry to 0 (free) in all FAT copies; reads each cluster's next-pointer *before* freeing it; loop-guarded. FAT16/32 only.
- **`fatfs_delete`** — mark the dirent `0xE5` **first** (file no longer referenced), **then** free the chain. So a crash between leaves leaked clusters (fsck-reclaimable), never a live dirent → free chain (the forbidden cross-link state).
- **`fatfs_truncate_zero`** — clear the dirent's `FstClusHI/LO` + `FileSize` **first**, then free the old chain. Same crash-safe ordering. (Arbitrary-length truncate is a follow-on.)
- **`fatfs_find_inner`** now records the matched dirent's location (`fatfs_slot_sec`/`fatfs_slot_idx`) so delete/truncate can modify it in place — a side effect on the existing read-path find; read behaviour is otherwise unchanged.

**Verification** — production build 729,232 → **731,072 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; FAT read regression intact (`chain-read OK`). `fat-write-smoke.sh` extended: writes + **deletes** `DELME.BIN` (multi-cluster) and writes + **truncates** `TRUNC.BIN` to zero, gating `fatw: delete … wrc=0 drc=0` + `fatw: trunc … wrc=0 trc=0` + **`fsck.fat -n` clean after freeing both chains** (no leaked clusters — the stringent part) + `mdir` shows `DELME.BIN` absent + `mtype` shows `TRUNC.BIN` is 0 bytes. The core FAT mutation set (create / write / delete / truncate) is now complete and every operation is `fsck.fat`-clean. **Next (bite 3d): LFN write + shell verbs** (`touch`/`rm`/`echo>` on the FAT mount). Still pending before the iron burn: the ESP-write safety guard.

### Added — bite 3d: FAT write — LFN (long filename) create (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

Long-filename write, so the FAT writer handles real-world names (not just 8.3). Audit § 2.4. **Shell verbs are deliberately *not* part of this bite** — they belong with the **1.39.x VFS generic-write lift** (which FAT write is the trigger for); bolting `fat*`-prefixed shell commands now would be a throwaway surface, so unified shell access across ext2+FAT waits for the VFS layer.

- **`fat_lfn_checksum`** — the 8-bit rotate-and-add checksum of the 11-byte 8.3 alias that links each LFN entry to its short entry.
- **`fatfs_name_fits_83`** — routes clean 8.3 names (≤8.3, ≤1 dot) through the existing `fatfs_create`; only longer/multi-dot names take the LFN path.
- **`fatfs_gen_alias`** — generates a unique `BASIS~N.EXT` 8.3 alias (basis = first ≤6 upper-cased name chars; `N` = first free 1–9, uniqueness via the new **`fatfs_alias_exists`** dir scan).
- **`fatfs_find_free_run`** — finds `K+1` *contiguous* free slots within one dir sector (the LFN set must be contiguous), so the whole set lands in one sector read-modify-write (cross-sector runs are a follow-on).
- **`fatfs_emit_lfn`** — fills one LFN entry: sequence (`|0x40` on the last), 13 UTF-16 chars (0x0000 terminator + 0xFFFF padding past the end), attr `0x0F`, checksum, `FstClusLO=0`.
- **`fatfs_create_lfn`** — writes `K = ceil(namelen/13)` LFN entries in reverse sequence order followed by the 8.3 alias entry. Empty file (cluster 0, size 0). LFN-with-content + LFN refuse-exists are follow-ons.

**Verification** — production build 731,072 → **738,272 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; FAT read regression intact (`chain-read OK`). `fat-write-smoke.sh` creates `LongFileName12345.txt` (21 chars → 2 LFN entries) and gates `fatw: lfn create rc=0` + **`fsck.fat -n` clean** + **`mdir` reconstructs the exact long name** — which means the reverse-ordered LFN chain *and* the 8.3-alias checksum that links it are correct (mtools/fsck validate the checksum; a wrong layout shows a broken name or fsck error). **Bite 3 (FAT write) complete: create / write / delete / truncate / LFN, all `fsck.fat`-clean.** Per the 2026-05-26 FS-scope decision, **exFAT (bite 4) moves to a 1.34.1 cut**; the remaining 1.34.0 work is bite 3e write-polish (overwrite-existing + arbitrary-length truncate + ENOSPC rollback). The ESP-write iron-safety guard stays pending before any iron burn.

### Added — bite 3e: FAT write polish — overwrite-existing + arbitrary truncate + ENOSPC rollback (`core/fatfs.cyr`, `core/main.cyr`, `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh`)

Closes the deferred write follow-ons; completes bite 3 (FAT write).

- **Overwrite-existing** — `fatfs_write_file` no longer refuses an existing name: it reuses that dirent slot, clears its cluster+size, frees the old chain (dirent-first ordering), then writes the new content. 8.3-name match only (overwriting an LFN file by its long name needs LFN read-match — a follow-on).
- **ENOSPC rollback** — on `fat_alloc_cluster` exhaustion mid-write, the partial chain is freed (`fat_free_chain(first)`) before returning -1, so a failed write leaves no leaked clusters.
- **`fatfs_truncate(name, newlen)`** — arbitrary-length shrink: keep `ceil(newlen/cluster)` clusters, write the smaller size + cap the new last cluster EOC, then free the orphaned tail (ordered so a crash leaks the tail rather than leaving a live dirent → free chain). `newlen == 0` delegates to `fatfs_truncate_zero`; grow-truncate is a follow-on.

**Verification** — production build 738,272 → **740,272 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; FAT read regression intact. `fat-write-smoke.sh` now gates all of 3a–3e: writes `WOVER.BIN` 1000 B then **overwrites** with 2000 B (`mtype` = the 2000 B second write byte-exact — old chain freed/replaced, not appended), and writes `TRUNC2.BIN` 3000 B then **truncates** to 1000 B (`mtype` = first 1000 B byte-exact — tail freed, size updated), with **`fsck.fat -n` clean** through every freed chain (no leaked clusters). ENOSPC rollback is code-complete (defensive; not directly exercised — filling a 127 MiB FS in the smoke is impractical).

**1.34.0 CYCLE QEMU-COMPLETE** — `fatfs` matured from a toy whole-disk FAT16-RO virtio-only reader into a real partition-aware multi-backend FAT12/16/32 driver with full read (FAT32 + cluster-chain) and write (create / multi-cluster content / delete / truncate-to-zero / arbitrary-truncate / LFN-create / overwrite), every mutation `fsck.fat -n`-clean + `mtype`-verified on a FAT32 ESP alongside live boot files. Shell verbs deferred to the 1.39.x VFS lift (FAT write is its trigger). **exFAT → 1.34.1.** Before any iron burn: the ESP-write safety guard (prefer Microsoft-Basic-Data for the write mount, or refuse ESP-type writes). The new `FATFS_SELFTEST` / `FATFS_WRITE_SELFTEST` build flags + `scripts/fat-smoke.sh` / `scripts/fat-write-smoke.sh` gate the read + write paths.

## [1.33.5] — 2026-05-26 (the last 1.33.x WRITE-arc follow-on — the **`fsync`/FLUSH-CACHE durability barrier**. 1.33.3's `sync` verb is honest only at the *filesystem* level: it flips `s_state` back to clean and `blk_write` runs synchronously (the NVMe/AHCI command *completes* before returning, § 2.3 of [`ext2-ext4-write-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext2-ext4-write-prior-art.md)), so kernel step-ordering *is* on-disk ordering — but a drive's own **volatile write cache** can still hold those sectors. A power-cycle in the seconds after `sync` can therefore lose data the controller acknowledged but the drive hadn't yet committed to NAND/platter. This cycle closes that gap: a real device-level cache-flush — **NVMe FLUSH** (NVM cmd opcode 0x00), **ATA FLUSH CACHE EXT** (0xEA via AHCI), **SCSI SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)** (0x35 over USB-MS BBB), **VirtIO `VIRTIO_BLK_T_FLUSH`** (type 4, when the FLUSH feature is negotiated; no-op otherwise), and a **RAM-disk no-op** — fanned out through a new `blk_flush()` dispatch mirroring the `blk_write`/`blk_read` precedent (`core/block.cyr`), then hooked into `ext2_sync()` so the `sync` verb becomes a true durability barrier. **Lean cycle-open** — VERSION 1.33.4 → 1.33.5, this header, tracking surface; no code bites yet. Multi-source audit first per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]] (NVM Express FLUSH + ATA8-ACS FLUSH CACHE EXT + SBC SYNCHRONIZE CACHE + VirtIO 1.x FLUSH + Linux `blkdev_issue_flush` / FreeBSD `BIO_FLUSH`); each bite a QEMU smoke gate; **NO iron burn until the final bite**, per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. After this, the 1.33.x patch line CLOSES — the big own-cycle writes (ext4 extent allocation, jbd2 journaling, VFS generic-write) are 1.37.x–1.39.x. Bite plan + falsification rubric: [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1335-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1335-cycle).)

### Added — bite 2: `blk_flush()` dispatch + NVMe / AHCI cache-flush, wired into `ext2_sync()` (`core/block.cyr`, `core/nvme.cyr`, `core/ahci.cyr`, `core/ext2.cyr`)

The dispatch + the two **iron** backends (NVMe primary, AHCI secondary on archaemenid). Per the bite-1 audit ([`flush-cache-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/flush-cache-prior-art.md)), each flush helper mirrors the driver's existing command path with the opcode swapped / data phase dropped.

- **`blk_flush()` / `blk_flush_on(tag)`** (`block.cyr`) — flush mirror of `blk_write_on`, same `blk_registered`-bit gate. `ext2_sync()` calls `blk_flush_on(ext2_backend)`.
- **`nvme_blk_flush`** (`nvme.cyr`) — NVMe FLUSH (NVM cmd opcode 0x00, NSID 1, no PRP, no CDWs) via the already-generic `nvme_io_submit`. `nvme_io_poll` was refactored into `nvme_io_poll_n(cid, max_iters)` + a thin default wrapper so the **transfer path is byte-unchanged** (still the 10M-iter budget); flush uses a **300M-iter ceiling** — a cache flush can take seconds while the drive commits its cache, where a single-LBA transfer never does, so reusing the transfer timeout would false-timeout a healthy flush.
- **`ahci_blk_flush`** via new non-data **`ahci_issue_nodata(port, opcode)`** (`ahci.cyr`) — FLUSH CACHE EXT (0xEA). Sibling of `ahci_issue_rw`: same present/inited/`ahci_port_wait_idle` guards and the same `ahci_build_rw_fis` scaffolding (lba=0/count=0 — FLUSH CACHE EXT ignores both), but the command header sets **PRDTL=0** (no PRDT) and W=0, and the completion poll uses the new **`AHCI_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_SPINS` (30M, ~30× the transfer ceiling)** for the same seconds-long-flush reason.
- **`ext2_sync()`** (`ext2.cyr`) — appends `blk_flush_on(ext2_backend)` **after** the clean-state superblock write (every preceding `blk_write_on` already completed at the controller; the flush pushes that controller-acked data through the drive's own cache to non-volatile media). The `sync` shell verb is now a true end-to-end durability barrier, not just an FS-state flip.
- **VirtIO / USB-MS / RAM-disk flush** land in **bite 3**; until then `blk_flush_on` treats them as a documented no-op default (RAM-disk is volatile; VirtIO without `VIRTIO_BLK_F_FLUSH` and a cacheless USB stick are write-through — nothing to commit). The FS backend on iron + in the write-smoke is NVMe, so this default is unreached by the durability gate.

**Verification** — production build 707,896 → **710,328 B**; `test.sh` **4/4** (size ceiling 800 KB); `ext2-smoke` **5/5**. `ext2-write-smoke` **PASS on both** the real-partition `metadata_csum,64bit,extent` profile **and** the default stripped profile: the **`Wsync state`** self-test (which drives `ext2_sync()` → `blk_flush_on(NVMe)` → a real NVMe FLUSH against QEMU's `nvme` device) passes, **`e2fsck -fn` clean (exit 0)**, no `nvme: I/O poll timeout` / CID mismatch in the boot log, and the full W1–W5 + rename/`ln`/symlink regression stays green — the flush issues, completes status-OK, and does not perturb the write path. The NVMe flush is thus QEMU-validated end-to-end; the AHCI flush is code-complete and structurally identical to the proven `ahci_issue_rw` (not directly exercised by the NVMe-backed smoke — an AHCI-backed exercise can fold into bite 3 or a user iron burn).

### Added — bite 3: VirtIO / USB-MS / RAM-disk flush — closes the 1.33.5 cycle (`core/virtio_blk.cyr`, `arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr`, `core/ramdisk.cyr`, `core/block.cyr`)

The three remaining backends, completing `blk_flush_on`. Each per the bite-1 audit § 2.

- **VirtIO** (`virtio_blk.cyr`) — `vblk_negotiate_features` now opportunistically acks **`VIRTIO_BLK_F_FLUSH`** (bit 9) and latches `vblk_flush_supported`. New **`vblk_do_flush`** issues a **2-descriptor** no-data chain (header `VIRTIO_BLK_T_FLUSH`=4, sector reserved=0, + status) — distinct from the 3-descriptor read/write chain — reusing the same avail-ring/wmb/doorbell/used-poll machinery. **`vblk_blk_flush`** no-ops to success when the feature wasn't negotiated (write-through device — nothing to commit).
- **USB-MS** (`msc.cyr`) — **`msc_blk_flush`** issues **SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)** (0x35) as a no-data CDB (all-zero operands = flush whole device, IMMED=0) via the existing `msc_scsi_exec`. A cacheless stick answering INVALID OPCODE surfaces as a benign -1.
- **RAM-disk** (`ramdisk.cyr`) — **`ramdisk_blk_flush`** is an honest success no-op (volatile `pmm_alloc`-backed; no medium to commit to).
- **`blk_flush_on`** (`block.cyr`) — the three bite-2 no-op default arms promoted to real `vblk_blk_flush` / `msc_blk_flush` / `ramdisk_blk_flush` calls; dispatch is now fully populated.

**Verification** — production build 710,328 → **712,504 B**; `test.sh` **4/4**; `ext2-smoke` **5/5**; NVMe `ext2-write-smoke` regression **PASS** (both `metadata_csum,64bit,extent` and stripped profiles). **VirtIO flush validated end-to-end**: a `virtio-blk-pci`-backed boot of the self-test kernel mounts ext2 on **`backend=1` (VIRTIO)** with `nvme: no controller found`, so `Wsync` drives `ext2_sync()` → `vblk_blk_flush()` → (F_FLUSH negotiated under QEMU's default writeback cache) `vblk_do_flush()` — **`Wsync state` OK**, **`e2fsck -fn` clean**, and QEMU's strict virtqueue validation raised **zero** descriptor-chain complaints on stderr (a malformed 2-desc chain would warn). USB-MS `msc_blk_flush` (reuses the Attempt-87-validated `msc_scsi_exec`) + RAM-disk no-op are code-complete; AHCI flush from bite 2 likewise. **1.33.5 CYCLE QEMU-COMPLETE** — all five block backends carry a flush, `sync` is an end-to-end durability barrier, and the 1.33.x ext2/ext4 WRITE patch line **closes here** (the big own-cycle writes — ext4 extent allocation / jbd2 journaling / VFS generic-write — are 1.37.x–1.39.x). An optional iron burn (`echo > /f; sync` on the real NVMe partition) is user-driven, not auto-proposed.

## [1.33.4] — 2026-05-26 (interactive-lockup fix **plus** the planned ext2/ext4 FS work — uninit_bg materialization + symlink resolution — folded back in after the lockup detour; fsync/FLUSH-CACHE slides to 1.33.5. The lockup trigger was an iron reproduction at 1.33.3 (photo `1333_issue_shown`): after a run of working `uptime`/`sync`/`ln`/`mv` commands the shell froze mid-keystroke on `echo hell` — the same delayed-idle lockup 1.33.2 hardened against defensively, now caught *during interactive input*, not after `bench`. Bite 1 = the lockup root-cause + fix (HID xfer-ring Link TRB); bites 2-3 = the FS items. The production-build scheduler-inert finding that retires 1.33.2's "prime suspect", the QEMU `usb-kbd`/`sendkey` repro harness, and per-bite detail live in [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1334-lockup`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1334-lockup).)

### Fixed — bite 1: HID keyboard transfer ring Link TRB (`arch/x86_64/usb/hid.cyr`)

**Root cause of the interactive lockup.** The HID keyboard's interrupt-IN transfer ring (256 TRBs, one page) was built with **no Link TRB** — `hid_kbd_configure` armed only Normal TRBs and `hid_arm_xfer_trb` wrapped the enqueue index `255 → 0` with nothing to tell the controller to return to slot 0. Per xHCI 1.2 §4.9.2.2 a transfer ring MUST end in a Link TRB; without one the controller, after consuming ~255 TRBs, advances past the page end into the next PMM page and the interrupt-IN endpoint stalls. Because the keyboard is polled continuously, a few seconds of typing exhausts the ring — keyboard input then wedges while the CPU stays alive on the timer (the shell `hlt`s forever waiting for a keystroke that never arrives), which from the user's seat looks like a hard freeze. The **command ring already had this right** (Link TRB at slot 255, `xhci_ring.cyr:203-206`, with cycle re-align on wrap in `xhci_cmd_submit`); the kbd transfer ring simply lacked the equivalent. MSC bulk transfers never tripped it (a few TRBs per command, never 256 in a session).

**Fix:** mirror the command-ring pattern — write a Link TRB at slot 255 (base → slot 0, Toggle Cycle set, initial cycle bit 0) in `hid_kbd_configure`, and in `hid_arm_xfer_trb` wrap at `idx == 255` by aligning the Link TRB's cycle bit to the current producer cycle, flipping the cycle, and resetting idx to 0 (slot 255 reserved, never armed with a Normal TRB).

**Reproduced + verified off-iron.** New diagnostic harness `scripts/lockup-repro.sh` + `scripts/lockup-driver.py` boots the production kernel (gnoboot+OVMF) with `qemu-xhci` + `usb-kbd` and types commands over QMP `send-key`, using each `uptime`'s live `timer_ticks` as a liveness canary. **Pre-fix:** froze at `agnos> u`, tick ~600, within ~18 commands, in two runs (`query-status: running:True` — vCPU alive, keyboard dead). **Post-fix:** a 300 s run drove 440+ commands with `timer_ticks` rising monotonically past 15,900 across dozens of ring wraps, serial log growing continuously, zero stall. Build 692,112 → **692,384 B**, fmt clean; no FS change, so `ext2-smoke` / `ext2-write-smoke` regressions unaffected.

### Added — bite 2: symlink resolution (`core/ext2.cyr`)

Completes the symlink feature 1.33.3 started (create-only). **`ext2_path_lookup` now FOLLOWS symlinks**: a path component that resolves to a symlink inode (mode `0xA000`) has its target read (new **`ext2_readlink`** — fast inline at inode offset 40 when `i_blocks == 0`; slow targets via the extent/indirect-aware `ext2_logical_to_physical`, since Linux ext4 slow symlinks are extent-mapped) and spliced ahead of the unparsed path remainder. Absolute targets restart at root; relative targets continue from the directory containing the link. ELOOP-capped at 8 follows. So `cat`/`cd`/`open` through a symlink now reach the target — previously they got the symlink's own inode. Resolution runs on a module-global 4 KB work buffer (PATH_MAX); the kernel is single-threaded so the shared scratch is safe.

**Verified** — new `ext2w: Wsymres resolve OK` self-test (in `ext2-write-smoke.sh`): a fast symlink `/sl_f → /hl_b.txt` and a relative symlink `/rl → hl_b.txt` both resolve to `hl_b.txt`'s inode; a self-referential `/lp → lp` returns -1 (ELOOP) instead of hanging. `e2fsck -fn` clean; full W1-W5 + rename/ln/sym-create regression green.

### Added — bite 3: uninit-group materialization (`core/ext2.cyr`)

**Closes a latent corruption risk on the real iron partition.** A default `mkfs.ext4` (metadata_csum + flex_bg) flags metadata-free groups `INODE_UNINIT` / `BLOCK_UNINIT` and leaves their bitmaps un-written on disk (calculable from the descriptor). The allocators trusted the on-disk bitmap, so allocating into an uninit group would scan stale data **and** leave the UNINIT flag set → an `e2fsck` inconsistency. This was invisible to the existing write-smoke because its 67 MiB partition is a single group (group 0, always initialized). Note this is the metadata_csum uninit **bg_flags**, distinct from the legacy `uninit_bg`/`GDT_CSUM` ro_compat feature (0x10), which stays refused (different crc16 checksum algorithm) — the mount gate is unchanged.

New **`ext2_materialize_inode_bitmap`** / **`ext2_materialize_block_bitmap`**: on first allocation into an uninit group the allocator writes the correct bitmap (all-free + the trailing/padding bits, since flex_bg relocates all metadata to the leader groups and uninit groups are never sparse_super backups), recomputes its CRC32c, and clears the bg_flag. The block side carries a safety guard (`ext2_group_has_super` + in-group bitmap/inode-table checks) that **refuses** to materialize any group that could hold metadata, so the allocator skips it rather than ever authoring a wrong bitmap. New group-descriptor accessors `ext2_grp_inode_table` / `ext2_grp_bg_flags`. Reference: Linux `ext4_init_block_bitmap` / `ext4_mark_bitmap_end`; e2fsprogs `ext2fs_block_bitmap`.

**Verified** — new `scripts/ext2-uninit-smoke.sh` builds a ~1.1 GiB journal-free flex_bg `mkfs.ext4` image (9 groups: 8 `INODE_UNINIT`, 3 `BLOCK_UNINIT`) and gates on `ext2w: Wuninit materialize OK` — the self-test forces a goal-directed block allocation into a `BLOCK_UNINIT` group (full allocator path: materialize → alloc → flag cleared) and materializes an `INODE_UNINIT` group's bitmap — plus **`e2fsck -fn` clean** on the post-boot partition. The single-group write-smoke prints `Wuninit SKIP` (hooks are no-ops there) and stays green. Build 692,384 → **707,896 B**; `test.sh` size ceiling 700 KB → 800 KB.

## [1.33.3] — 2026-05-25 (ext2/ext4 WRITE arc continued — the dirent-mutation follow-ons (moved here from 1.33.2, which shipped as the standalone lockup-hardening cut). Now that the indirect-write path is iron-proven (1.33.1 W5: `echo > /persist.txt` survives a power-cycle on the unmodified default `mkfs.ext4`), the operations that ride W4's dirent insert/remove + inode primitives become cheap follow-ons: **`rename`/`mv`** (dirent-insert at the new parent + dirent-remove at the old; fix `..` on directory moves), **hardlink/`ln`** (dirent-insert + `i_links_count` bump; refuse cross-device + dir hardlinks), **symlink-create/`ln -s`** (fast symlink inline in `i_block` ≤ 59 B, slow symlink in a data block). Plus the honest no-journal story: **`s_state` dirty-on-first-write / clean-on-`sync`** + a **`sync` shell verb** (a yanked burn then shows dirty → user knows to `e2fsck`). Audit-first per [`ext2-ext4-write-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/ext2-ext4-write-prior-art.md) § 4; each bite `e2fsck -fn`-clean (Pass-4 link accounting is the oracle) on the `metadata_csum,64bit` image before the next; iron burn only at the final bite. Cycle-open is lean — VERSION + header + tracking surface, no bites yet. Bite plan + falsification rubric: [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1333-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1333-cycle). Remaining 1.33.x follow-ons slot into 1.33.4 (uninit_bg materialization + symlink resolution) / 1.33.5 (fsync barrier); the big write cycles (ext4 extent allocation, jbd2 journaling) are own-cycles at 1.37.x–1.39.x — see roadmap row 15.)

### Added — bite 1: `rename` / `mv` (`ext2.cyr`, `shell.cyr`)

First WRITE follow-on. **`ext2_rename(src_parent, src_name, dst_parent, dst_name)`** composed from the W4 dirent insert/remove + inode primitives — no new on-disk format. Ordered writes per prior-art § 3: add the NEW dirent first (the inode is reachable by both names through the window, never unreferenced), then on a cross-parent *directory* move repoint the moved dir's `..` and shift parent link counts (old parent −1, new parent +1), then remove the OLD dirent last. New helpers `ext2_ftype_from_mode` / `ext2_dir_set_dotdot` / `ext2_is_ancestor`. Base-stage limits (each e2fsck-safe): refuses dst-exists (rename-replace is a follow-on), self-move, and dir-into-own-descendant (the `..` cycle e2fsck would otherwise have to cut). Plus the **`mv SRC DST` shell verb** (two-path split; the src basename is copied to a local before the dst is resolved, since `sh_abspath`/`sh_split_parent` share `sh_path_buf`).

**Verified** — `scripts/ext2-write-smoke.sh` on the **`metadata_csum,64bit,extent`** profile (the real default-`mkfs.ext4` layout): self-test `Wren file` + `Wren xdir` (cross-parent dir move) + `Wren refuse` all OK; **`e2fsck -fn` clean (exit 0)** incl. Pass-4 link accounting; host `debugfs` confirms `/rndst.txt` present + `/rnsrc.txt` gone (file rename persisted) and `/rnp/rnd` is a directory + `/rnd` gone from root (cross-parent move persisted). No regression — W1–W5 + W4b all still PASS. Production build 675,472 → **682,952 B**.

**Fixed** — `ext2-write-smoke.sh` profile-comment corrected: the checksummed example was missing `extent`, and `mkfs` rejects `64bit` without it ("Extents MUST be enabled for a 64-bit filesystem"). The real-partition profile is `metadata_csum,64bit,extent`.

### Added — bite 2: hardlink / `ln` (`ext2.cyr`, `shell.cyr`)

**`ext2_link(target_ino, dst_parent, dst_name)`** — a second dirent for an existing inode + `i_links_count++`. The count is bumped FIRST, then the dirent added (rolled back on insert failure), per § 3: a crash then leaves a too-HIGH count (a harmless leak e2fsck reclaims) rather than a too-LOW count that a later unlink could drive to 0 and free a still-referenced inode. Refuses directory hardlinks (would break the tree) + dst-exists. `ext2_unlink` already decrements-and-conditionally-frees, so a multi-link file unwinds correctly when one name is removed. Plus the **`ln SRC NEWNAME` shell verb** (SRC resolved to an inode before the dst path reuses `sh_path_buf`).

**Verified** — `ext2-write-smoke.sh` on `metadata_csum,64bit,extent`: `Whard link` (hardlink → unlink one name → the other survives, nlink 2→1) + `Whard refuse-dir` (dir hardlink refused) OK; **`e2fsck -fn` clean incl. Pass-4 link accounting**; host `debugfs` confirms `/hl_b.txt`="HL" survives the unlink of `/hl_a.txt`, and `/hl_d2` is absent (dir hardlink refused). No regression. Build 682,952 → **686,576 B**.

### Added — bite 3: symlink-create / `ln -s` (`ext2.cyr`, `shell.cyr`)

**`ext2_symlink(parent, name, target)`** — allocates an `S_IFLNK` inode (mode 0xA1FF). **Fast symlink** (target < 60 B) stores the target inline in the 60-byte `i_block` array (`i_blocks=0`, no data block); **slow symlink** (≥ 60 B) writes it to one indirect-mapped data block. dirent `file_type` 7; refuses dst-exists. The rollback path deliberately never calls `ext2_truncate_zero` on a fast symlink — its `i_block` holds target *text*, not block pointers, so interpreting it as block numbers would free random blocks. Plus **`ln -s TARGET LINK`** flag-parsing folded into the shared `ln` verb (TARGET stored verbatim, not path-resolved). This bite only *creates* symlinks e2fsck-clean — *resolving* them on traversal is the 1.33.4 item.

**Verified** — `ext2-write-smoke.sh` on `metadata_csum,64bit,extent`: `Wsym fast` (inline target, `i_blocks=0`) + `Wsym slow` (data-block target) OK; **`e2fsck -fn` clean** (validates both fast/slow symlink formats); host `debugfs` confirms `/sl_f` is a symlink with fast-link target `/hl_b.txt`, and `/sl_s` is a slow symlink. No regression. Build 686,576 → **690,816 B**.

### Added — bite 4: `s_state` dirty/clean + `sync` verb (`ext2.cyr`, `shell.cyr`) — closes 1.33.3

The honest no-journal story (prior-art § 10 item 4). **`ext2_mark_dirty()`** clears `EXT2_VALID_FS` in the superblock `s_state` (offset 0x3A) on the FIRST write of a mount and flushes the SB, latched by an in-memory `ext2_fs_dirty` flag (so the dirty SB is written once); hooked into `ext2_write_block` — safe because `ext2_write_superblock` writes via `blk_write` directly, not through `write_block`, so no recursion. **`ext2_sync()`** sets `EXT2_VALID_FS` back + flushes. So a power-cycle *after* `sync` leaves an e2fsck-"clean" FS, while a yanked burn *without* `sync` leaves it "not cleanly unmounted" → the user knows to check. AGNOS writes synchronously through `blk_write` (no writeback cache, § 2.3), so there's no cached data to flush here — only the state bit; a real drive FLUSH-CACHE barrier is the separate 1.33.5 item. Plus the **`sync` shell verb**.

**Verified** — `ext2-write-smoke.sh` on `metadata_csum,64bit,extent`: `Wsync state` confirms `s_state` reads DIRTY after the earlier bites' writes and CLEAN after `sync`; host `debugfs show_super_stats` confirms on-disk **Filesystem state: clean**; **`e2fsck -fn` clean**. No regression. Build 690,816 → **692,112 B**.

**1.33.3 CYCLE CLOSED (QEMU-complete)** — the four dirent-mutation follow-ons (rename/`mv`, hardlink/`ln`, symlink-create/`ln -s`, `s_state`/`sync`) all land `e2fsck -fn`-clean on the real default-`mkfs.ext4` profile. An iron burn (`mv`/`ln`/`ln -s` on the real partition → power-cycle → persists) is available but user-driven, not auto-proposed.

## [1.33.2] — 2026-05-25 (lockup-hardening — bench + serial stability. A reported lockup at the **idle shell, a few seconds–to–a-minute *after* `bench` completes** (not during) prompted fixes for the three small unbounded/unguarded spots in the bench + serial path — concrete defects that could leave corrupted state for the per-tick scheduler to trip later. Cut and released on its own as the stability fix. The ext2/ext4 WRITE follow-ons (rename / hardlink / symlink-create + `s_state`/`sync`) originally scoped under this number **moved to 1.33.3** — see that entry and [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1333-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1333-cycle).)

### Fixed — lockup-hardening: bounded serial poll + bench memory guards

Defensive fixes for the three unbounded/unguarded spots in the `bench` + serial path, after a reported lockup at the **idle shell a few seconds–to–a-minute *after* `bench` completes** (not during). These remove the small, concrete defects that could leave corrupted state for the per-tick scheduler (`timer_handler` → `do_context_switch`, `pic.cyr:36`) to trip later; build 675,152 → **675,472 B**, `test.sh` 4/4, FS smokes unaffected (read/serial/bench paths only).

- **`serial_putc` THR-empty poll is now bounded** (`arch/x86_64/serial.cyr`). The old inline-asm `jz` spin (`in al,0x3FD; test al,0x20; jz back`) had **no iteration cap** — a 16550 whose LSR THR-empty bit never sets would spin the CPU forever. Rewritten as a bounded Cyrius loop over `inb`/`outb` (cap 100k, then drop the char). Per [[feedback_no_serial_on_iron]] archaemenid has no serial cable, so serial output must never be able to wedge the box; every other AGNOS hardware poll is already bounded.
- **`bench` memwrite guards `pmm_alloc()` == 0** (`user/shell.cyr`). `pmm_alloc()` returns 0 on exhaustion; the unguarded `store64(mem_pg + j, …)` would have written `0xDEADBEEF` across physical 0–4095 (IVT / low page tables / kernel structures) → a corruption that faults *later* at idle. Now skips the memwrite tier when no page is available.
- **`bench` memfile loop guards the `vfs_create_memfile` fd** (`user/shell.cyr`). A `-1` return (full 32-slot `vfs_table`) fed to `vfs_read(-1, …)` indexes 32 bytes before the table (OOB). Now gated on `fd >= 0`.

**Caveat**: these are hardening of the concrete small defects; the reported delayed-idle lockup's root cause is not yet iron-confirmed. The prime remaining suspect is the per-tick context-switch path (`timer_handler` documents a *prior* delayed-idle lockup from a register-save bug "when the kernel idle proc was re-selected", `pic.cyr:48-54`) — if the lockup survives these fixes, that path needs iron observability (user-driven burn, not auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]).

## [1.33.1] — 2026-05-25 (ext2/ext4 WRITE on a REAL `mkfs.ext4` partition — the 1.33.0 WRITE arc was QEMU-complete, but the W2 safety gate refuses mutation on the default-`mkfs.ext4` agnos-fs partition by design (`metadata_csum` + `64bit` set). **First iron exposure (photo `1330_failed_writes`) confirmed the gate exactly**: clean boot → `ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096…)` → `ext2w: read-only FS -- write checks skipped`, every shell verb (`mkdir`/`touch`/`rm`/`echo>`) fails. The QEMU smoke only passed because it targets a feature-stripped `-O ^metadata_csum,^64bit,^uninit_bg` image. This cycle implements what a *correct* writer must maintain so both refusals can be lifted and writes land on an **unmodified** default partition: **64bit BGDT `_hi`-half writes** + **CRC32c (Castagnoli, poly `0x82F63B78`) metadata checksums** across superblock / group descriptors / block+inode bitmaps / inodes / directory-leaf tails. Audit-first per the augmented prior-art doc § 14; `e2fsck -fn` against a `metadata_csum,64bit` image is the per-bite oracle; the W5 iron burn (create → power-cycle → persists on the real partition) is the close criterion.)

**🎯 W5 iron burn — PASS (2026-05-25, photo `1331_After_Reboot`).** `echo > /persist.txt` → **power-cycle** → `agnos> ls` returns `./ ../ lost+found/ hello.txt welcome.txt agnos/ persist.txt` on the **unmodified default `mkfs.ext4`** agnos-fs partition. The created file survived the reboot — the close criterion is met, metadata_csum + 64bit write is iron-validated, and the ext2/ext4 WRITE arc clears the demo→base maturity boundary on real NAND. Released 2026-05-25.

### Added — bite 1: 64bit BGDT write + extent-write safety guard (`ext2.cyr`)

First bite of the real-`mkfs.ext4` arc. The 1.33.0 W2 gate refused `64bit` (incompat `0x80`) outright; a multi-source re-derivation (audit § 14.4, e2fsprogs `csum.c` + ext4 layout) showed the refusal was over-conservative: on a <16 TB FS every `bg_*_hi` half (block/inode/itable pointers *and* free counts) is genuinely 0, the existing 16/32-bit lo-field stores touch only the lo bytes, and the whole-block read-modify-write preserves the zeroed `_hi` words; `ext2_desc_size` already supplies the 64-byte BGDT stride. So **64bit write needed zero store changes** — only lifting the gate's `incompat & 0x80` refusal (`metadata_csum` 0x400 still gates the real partition until the csum bites land).

- **Extent-write safety guard** — surfaced while building the 64bit smoke target (`64bit` forces `extent`, so the mkfs `-d` seed files are extent-mapped): `ext2_bmap_alloc` walked `i_block[]` as direct/indirect pointers with **no `EXTENTS_FL` check**, so overwriting/appending a Linux-created (extent-mapped) file or directory would have misread the extent header as a block pointer and corrupted the tree — a latent hazard the stripped-image smoke never hit. `ext2_bmap_alloc` / `ext2_write_at` / `ext2_truncate_zero` now refuse extent-mapped inodes (`i_flags & 0x80000`) cleanly; extent *allocation* stays a deferred cycle (audit § 11). New AGNOS files are always indirect (`ext2_create` zeroes `i_flags`), and inserting a dirent into an **existing** extent-mapped dir block still works (the extent walker reads the block, the dirent write puts it back directly — only block *append* lands in the guard), so the demo→base path (`echo hi > /newfile`) is unaffected on the real partition.
- **`EXT2_WRITE_SELFTEST` W3 hardening** — W3 (write@0 / sparse / truncate) now runs against self-created files (`/w3a.txt`, `/w3b.txt`, always indirect) instead of the mkfs seeds, so it exercises the real write+alloc path on **every** image profile (stripped / 64bit / metadata_csum) rather than depending on the seed's block-map kind.
- **`scripts/ext2-write-smoke.sh`** — the mkfs `-O` feature set is now parameterized via `EXT2_SMOKE_FEATURES` (default = the 1.33.0 stripped profile), so one script gates every bite of this arc by swapping only the image profile.

**Verification**: production build **667,128 B** (+288 vs 1.33.0; the gate-lift saved a branch, the extent guards + W3 rework added it back). **Regression — stripped image**: `ext2-write-smoke.sh` W1-W5 + shell verbs all PASS, `e2fsck -fn` clean, host `debugfs` confirms persistence. **Bite-1 proof — `64bit,extent,^metadata_csum` image**: `ext2_write_ok=1`, the **entire** mutation set (alloc/free round-trip, write/sparse/truncate, create/unlink, mkdir/rmdir, shell `echo>`/`touch`/`rm`) runs **green**, `e2fsck -fn` clean, `/w3b.txt` 8292 / `/w3a.txt` 0 / `/w4keep.txt` / `/shdir/keep.txt` all persisted on the 64bit on-disk image. No regression (`test.sh` + `ext2-smoke.sh` unaffected — read paths only). **Next: bite 2** (`ext2_crc32c` Castagnoli primitive + mount-time `ext2_csum_seed`).

### Added — bite 2: CRC32c (Castagnoli) primitive + mount-time csum seed (`ext2.cyr`)

The metadata_csum substrate — no behavior change yet (write stays gated), just the building block every later checksum bite consumes.

- **`ext2_crc32c(crc, buf, len)`** — Castagnoli CRC (bit-reflected poly `0x82F63B78`), distinct from `gpt.cyr`'s IEEE-802.3 CRC32 (`0xEDB88320`). Two deliberate departures from `gpt_crc32` per audit § 14.1 (e2fsprogs `lib/ext2fs/csum.c`): **no implicit init and no final XOR** — the caller passes the running `crc` (a seed, or `0xFFFFFFFF`) and the raw result is used as-is, because ext4 folds those into how seeds are threaded. Same reflected shift-right structure as the proven `gpt_crc32_chunk`.
- **`ext2_csum_on` / `ext2_csum_seed`** (module globals) computed at mount: `csum_on = (ro_compat & 0x400)`; the seed is `s_checksum_seed` (+0x270) when the `CSUM_SEED` incompat feature (0x2000) is set, else `crc32c(~0, s_uuid[16] @ +0x68)` — the common default-`mkfs.ext4` path. (`ext2_sb_checksum_seed` accessor added.)
- **Self-tests** (`EXT2_WRITE_SELFTEST`): a mount-independent vector check `ext2_crc32c(~0,"123456789",9) == 0x1CF96D7C` (which `^~0 == 0xE3069283`, the canonical iSCSI value — proves the algorithm is real CRC32C), plus a boot print of `csum on=<n> seed=<hex>`. The smoke now (a) gates on the vector and (b) when `csum on=1`, **cross-checks the kernel's seed against the host's UUID-derived `crc32c(~0,uuid,16)`** — proving the seed AGNOS will feed every checksum equals what `e2fsck` expects, before a single checksum is written.

**Verification**: production build **667,440 B**. **64bit image**: crc32c vector PASS + full W1-W5 mutation set still green + `e2fsck -fn` clean (no regression). **`metadata_csum,64bit` image**: `crc32c selftest OK`, `csum on=1 seed=e25418d4`, and **`PASS: csum seed matches host UUID-derived (0xe25418d4)`** — `ext2_crc32c` + `ext2_compute_csum_seed` validated end-to-end against `e2fsck`'s reference. Write correctly still gated (`read-only FS -- write checks skipped`) — the metadata_csum refusal flips in the final bite. **Next: bite 3** (superblock `s_checksum` + per-group `bg_checksum` hooks).

### Added — bite 3: superblock + group-descriptor checksums (`ext2.cyr`)

The first two checksum classes. Validated by **compute-and-compare against the on-disk values e2fsprogs already wrote** (the `e2fsck` reference) — write stays gated, so no risk, but the routines are proven exact before they're ever relied on.

- **`ext2_sb_csum_compute`** — `crc32c(~0, sb, 0x3FC)` over the first 1020 bytes (everything before `s_checksum` @ 0x3FC). Seeded with `~0`, **not** `ext2_csum_seed` — the superblock is the one structure seeded with all-ones (audit § 14.3). The compute ends at 0x3FC, so it naturally excludes the stored field (no zeroing dance). Full 32-bit.
- **`ext2_grp_csum_compute`** — e2fsprogs `ext2fs_group_desc_csum` for metadata_csum: `crc32c(seed, group#_le32)` → descriptor `[0, 0x1E)` → 2 zero bytes standing in for the `bg_checksum` field → (64bit only) `[0x20, desc_size)`; low 16 bits, stored at 0x1E. **`ext2_bgdt_recsum`** recomputes every valid group in the loaded BGDT block.
- **Hooks**: `ext2_write_superblock` rewrites `s_checksum` and `ext2_write_bgdt` calls `ext2_bgdt_recsum`, both before the write, both guarded by `ext2_csum_on` (no-ops on a non-csum FS).
- **Self-test**: on a metadata_csum FS, computes the SB + group-0 checksums and compares to the on-disk values; smoke gates on `SB csum match` + `grp0 csum match`.

**Verification**: production build **669,072 B**. **`metadata_csum,64bit` image**: `SB csum match` + `grp0 csum match` — `ext2_sb_csum_compute` and `ext2_grp_csum_compute` reproduce e2fsprogs's `s_checksum` and `bg_checksum` exactly (seed `0x5ccda95c`, also host-matched). Write still gated (W3-W5 skip by design). **No regression**: 64bit image (`csum_on=0`) full W1-W5 mutation set still green + `e2fsck -fn` clean — the hooks are dormant. **Next: bite 4** (block + inode bitmap checksums in the BGDT, hooked into the four allocator paths).

### Added — bite 4: block + inode bitmap checksums (`ext2.cyr`)

The bitmap checksum fields live in the group descriptor and must be set whenever a bitmap is rewritten (then `bg_checksum` from bite 3 covers them — which is why these two bites pair).

- **`ext2_set_block_bitmap_csum`** — `crc32c(seed, bitmap, (blocks_per_group+7)/8)` → `bg_block_bitmap_csum_lo` @ 0x18 + `_hi` @ 0x38 (64bit).
- **`ext2_set_inode_bitmap_csum`** — `crc32c(seed, bitmap, (inodes_per_group+7)/8)` → `bg_inode_bitmap_csum_lo` @ 0x1A + `_hi` @ 0x3A. **The span is `inodes_per_group/8` (1024 B here), NOT the full block** — the #1 silent e2fsck trap (audit § 14.7); the block-bitmap span happens to equal the full 4096-B block only because `blocks_per_group/8 = 4096`.
- **Hooks**: all four allocator paths (`ext2_alloc_block`/`ext2_free_block`/`ext2_alloc_inode`/`ext2_free_inode`) set the bitmap csum right after writing the bitmap and before `ext2_write_bgdt` (so the same `write_bgdt` recomputes `bg_checksum` over the updated field), `csum_on`-guarded.
- **Self-test**: reads group-0's block + inode bitmaps, computes both csums, compares to the on-disk descriptor values.

**Verification**: production build **671,552 B**. **`metadata_csum,64bit` image**: `blk-bitmap csum match` + `ino-bitmap csum match` — both reproduce e2fsprogs's stored bitmap checksums (the inode-bitmap span correct at `ipg/8`). **No regression**: 64bit image full W1-W5 + `e2fsck -fn` clean. **Next: bite 5** (inode `i_checksum_lo`/`i_checksum_hi` in `ext2_put_inode`).

### Added — bite 5: inode checksums (`ext2.cyr`)

- **`ext2_inode_csum_calc`** (non-destructive: save/zero/crc/restore) + **`ext2_inode_csum_stamp`** (writes in place) — `crc32c(seed, ino#_le32)` → `+i_generation` (@100) → `+the whole inode` (`inode_size` bytes) with `i_checksum_lo` (@0x7C) and `i_checksum_hi` (@0x82) **zeroed during the crc** per e2fsprogs `ext2fs_inode_csum`. `lo16` → 0x7C; `hi16` → 0x82, gated on **`ext2_inode_has_hi`** (`inode_size > 128 && i_extra_isize @128 >= 4` — the `EXT4_FITS_IN_INODE` rule).
- **Hook**: `ext2_put_inode` stamps `in_buf` before the RMW splice, `csum_on`-guarded — so every inode written (`create`/`write_at`/`truncate`/`mkdir`/`unlink` link-count bumps) lands with a valid CRC32c.
- **Self-test**: compute-and-compare on the root inode (2).

**Verification**: production build **672,992 B**. **`metadata_csum,64bit` image**: `inode2 csum match` — `ext2_inode_csum_calc` reproduces e2fsprogs's inode checksum exactly. All five checksum classes now compute-and-compare clean (SB / group-desc / block-bitmap / inode-bitmap / inode). **No regression**: 64bit image full W1-W5 + `e2fsck -fn` clean. **Next: bite 6** (directory-leaf `det_checksum` + the 12-byte tail handling — the trickiest, since the rec_len walker must never reuse the tail).

### Added — bite 6: directory-leaf checksums + tail handling (`ext2.cyr`)

The trickiest checksum class — a metadata_csum leaf dir block reserves its last 12 bytes for an `ext4_dir_entry_tail` (fake `inode=0, rec_len=12, name_len=0, file_type=0xDE` whose final 4 bytes hold `det_checksum`).

- **`ext2_dir_limit`** — usable dirent region is `[0, blocksize-12)` on a csum FS (`blocksize` otherwise). **`ext2_dir_leaf_csum`** — `crc32c(seed, dir_ino#) → +dir i_generation → +dirents [0, blocksize-12)` (the tail is *not* covered). **`ext2_dir_tail_stamp`** — writes the tail header + `det_checksum`.
- **Walkers respect the tail**: `ext2_dir_try_insert` and `ext2_dir_remove` now iterate to `ext2_dir_limit()`, so the `0xDE` tail is never visited as a reusable tombstone (audit § 14.7).
- **Tail recomputed on every dir-block write**: `ext2_dir_insert` (both the slack-split and the fresh-block-append paths, the latter giving its first dirent `rec_len = ext2_dir_limit()`), `ext2_dir_remove` (after coalesce/tombstone), and `ext2_mkdir`'s seed block (`..` rec_len = `ext2_dir_limit()-12`; new dir's `i_generation` is 0). All `csum_on`-guarded; the dir inode's generation is read from the loaded inode buffer.
- **Self-test**: computes root's dir-block leaf csum and compares to the on-disk `det_checksum`.

**Verification**: production build **674,640 B**. **`metadata_csum,64bit` image**: `rootdir csum match` — `ext2_dir_leaf_csum` (with the dir-generation seeding) reproduces e2fsprogs's `det_checksum` exactly. **All six checksum classes now compute-and-compare clean.** **No regression** (the dir paths changed, so this matters): 64bit image full create/unlink/mkdir/rmdir/shell-verb set + `e2fsck -fn` clean, and the stripped image too — `ext2_dir_limit()` returns `blocksize` and the tail stamps are guarded off. **Next: bite 7** — flip `ext2_write_ok=1` on a metadata_csum FS and run the FULL write smoke (`e2fsck -fn` clean on the checksummed image), then the W5 iron burn.

### Added — bite 7: write a real default-`mkfs.ext4` partition (`ext2.cyr`) — QEMU-COMPLETE

The payoff. The write-safety gate drops `METADATA_CSUM` (0x400) from `ro_danger` (now just `uninit_bg` 0x10 + `bigalloc` 0x200 — separate features not set by default `mkfs.ext4`), so `ext2_write_ok=1` on a `metadata_csum` + `64bit` FS and every write recomputes its checksums through the bite 2-6 machinery.

- **`bg_itable_unused` accounting fix** — the full write smoke surfaced what the per-class compute-and-compare couldn't: the data persisted perfectly (host `debugfs` read every file), but `e2fsck` rejected the new inodes as *"found in group 0's unused inodes area"*, cascading into bitmap/dir-count/link-count diffs. Root cause: with group-desc checksums on, `bg_itable_unused` (@0x1C/@0x32) is a high-water mark of never-used inodes at the table tail; allocating into that region must shrink it. `ext2_alloc_inode` now lowers `bg_itable_unused` to `inodes_per_group-(idx+1)` when allocating past the watermark (freeing never raises it — matches e2fsprogs). This single fix cleared the entire `e2fsck` cascade. (Accessors `ext2_grp_itable_unused`/`_set_`.)

**Verification — the arc's headline**: production build **675,152 B**. **Full write smoke on a `metadata_csum,64bit,extent` image** (the default `mkfs.ext4` profile — the real agnos-fs partition's profile): the **entire** mutation set runs through the actual write path — alloc/free round-trip, write/sparse/truncate, create/unlink, mkdir/rmdir, shell `echo>`/`touch`/`rm` — **`e2fsck -fn` clean (exit 0)**, and host `debugfs` confirms every file persisted byte-correct. All six checksum classes (SB / group-desc / block-bitmap / inode-bitmap / inode / dir-leaf) + the `itable_unused` accounting are maintained on every write. **Full image-profile matrix green**: stripped / `64bit,^csum` / `metadata_csum,64bit` all PASS. **AGNOS can now create, write, and delete files on an UNMODIFIED default `mkfs.ext4` partition, e2fsck-clean — no re-carve.** **Remaining: the W5 iron burn** (user-driven, pre-burn audit landed at `agnosticos/docs/development/metadata-csum-write-iron-burn-audit.md`): boot on archaemenid against the real agnos-fs, `echo agnos > /persist.txt` → power-cycle → `cat /persist.txt`, then host `e2fsck -fn` on the pulled partition. The gate that started this cycle (`ext2w: read-only FS -- write checks skipped`, photo `1330_failed_writes`) now reads write-enabled.

## [1.33.0] — 2026-05-25 (ext2/ext4 WRITE arc OPEN — the demo→base maturity exit: filesystem mutation so state persists across reboots, not just *shown*. Audit-first per the multi-source convergent prior-art doc (agnosticos `docs/development/ext2-ext4-write-prior-art.md` — FreeBSD ext2fs primary, Linux ext2, OpenBSD, ext4 spec, e2fsprogs). Phased W1-W5: W1-W4 are QEMU `e2fsck -fn`-clean smoke gates, W5 is the iron burn (create file → power-cycle → persists). **The block-device write primitives already exist + are iron-validated** (`blk_write` → `nvme_blk_write`/`ahci_blk_write`, proven at USB-MS Attempt 87), so this arc is purely the ext2 metadata-mutation layer — zero driver work. Crash-consistency without a journal comes from ordered writes (audit § 3). Sections below land as W-phases complete.)

### Added — W1 write primitives + metadata write-back (`block.cyr`, `ext2.cyr`)

The foundation layer: the symmetric write siblings of the read path, plus a non-destructive self-test that proves them against a live mount.

- **`blk_write_on(tag, sector, buf)`** (`block.cyr`) — per-backend write dispatch mirroring `blk_read_on`. The ext2 write path routes mutations through this (via `ext2_backend`) so they land on the FS's actual backend, not the `blk_active` winner — the same decoupling the read path needs on archaemenid (agnos-fs may not be the override-policy winner).
- **`ext2_blk_write` / `ext2_write_block(block_num, buf)`** — block-granular write, the mirror of `ext2_read_block` (LBA via `ext2_block_to_lba`, sector loop via `blk_write_on`).
- **`ext2_write_superblock()`** — writes the in-memory superblock (`ext2_sb_buf`, 1024 B) back to LBA `first_lba+2..+3` directly (the SB lives at byte 1024 regardless of blocksize).
- **`ext2_put_inode(inode_num, in_buf)`** — inode write-back as **read-modify-write at block granularity** (an inode is `inode_size` B but the table is block-packed, so a bare-slice write would clobber neighbours). Location math mirrors `ext2_get_inode` exactly.
- **`ext2_store16_le` / `ext2_store32_le`** — endian byte stores (loaders' siblings); **`ext2_sb_free_blocks_count` / `_free_inodes_count`** read+store accessors (offsets +12/+16 — the read path never needed the free counts).
- **`ext2_write_selftest()`** (compile-gated `EXT2_WRITE_SELFTEST`, driven from `main.cyr` after `ext2_init()`) — NON-DESTRUCTIVE: reads grp-0 BGDT accounting + superblock free totals + the block-bitmap free-bit count, then identity-writes a metadata block and inode 2 (read → write unchanged → re-read → byte-compare). New `scripts/ext2-write-smoke.sh` boots it against a write-friendly ext2 image (`-O ^metadata_csum,^64bit,^dir_index,^uninit_bg`) and gates on the identity checks + `e2fsck -fn` clean.

**Verification**: production build **629,568 B** (+5,752 vs 1.32.9 — the write primitives, dead-code-eliminable until W2+ calls them). No regression: `scripts/test.sh` **4/4** + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` **5/5** (all backends reach `AGNOS shell v`, legacy + 64BIT BGDT). **W1 smoke PASS**: `grp0 free_blk` / `sb free_blk` / `bitmap free-bits` all = **16068**, byte-identical to host `debugfs -R stats` → free-count accessors + bitmap-read math validated; `ext2_write_block` + `ext2_put_inode` identity round-trips byte-clean; `e2fsck -fn` on the post-boot image **clean (exit 0)**. The block-device write primitives are themselves iron-validated (USB-MS Attempt 87). W1 is a QEMU gate — no iron burn (the W5 burn is the first WRITE iron exposure).

### Added — W2 block + inode allocators + write-safety gate (`ext2.cyr`)

Bitmap-walk allocators per the prior-art doc §§ 4-5 (FreeBSD `ext2_alloc` primary). The "find a block" read walkers now have "create a block" siblings.

- **`ext2_alloc_block(goal)` / `ext2_free_block(b)`** — block-bitmap walk with a goal-group hint + group wrap; full accounting (per-group `bg_free_blocks_count` + superblock `s_free_blocks_count`). We trust the bitmap — reserved regions are pre-set by mkfs, so a first-0-bit scan skips them. Double-free guard on the free path.
- **`ext2_alloc_inode(is_dir)` / `ext2_free_inode(i, is_dir)`** — inode-bitmap mirror; `is_dir` bumps/drops `bg_used_dirs_count`. First-fit group placement (Orlov deliberately not ported — placement is an optimization, not correctness, per doc § 5).
- **Commit ordering** (doc § 3): set the alloc bit + write the bitmap *before* the resource is used; bump free-counts (BGDT then superblock) *last* — a crash leaks (fsck-reclaimable) but never dangles.
- Supporting: `ext2_read_bgdt`/`ext2_write_bgdt`, group-descriptor field accessors+stores (`ext2_grp_*`), `ext2_ngroups`, bitmap bit helpers (`ext2_bitmap_get`/`set`/`clear`/`first_free`), `ext2_bitmap_buf` scratch (kept distinct from the BGDT/data buffers so an allocator can hold all three live).
- **Write-safety gate** (`ext2_write_ok`, set at mount per doc § 10): WRITE must honor `ro_compat` (a read-only mount ignores it). The FS still **reads** fully, but mutation is refused on `metadata_csum` (0x400) / `uninit_bg` (0x10) / `bigalloc` (0x200) / `64bit` (incompat 0x80) — the bits a naive writer would corrupt. `mkfs.ext4` defaults set `metadata_csum`+`64bit`, so the real agnos-fs partition refuses write until those deferred sub-cycles; the write smoke targets a `-O ^metadata_csum,^64bit,^uninit_bg` image. `ext2_put_inode` + all allocators check the flag.

**Verification**: production **640,848 B** (+11,280; allocators dead-code-eliminable until W3+). No regression (`ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5). **W2 smoke PASS** (`scripts/ext2-write-smoke.sh`): alloc 3 blocks + 1 inode (`blk 1084 1085 1086 ino 15`) → free all → free-counts return **exactly** to baseline (`16068 → 16068`, `17138 → 17138`); `e2fsck -fn` on the post-boot image **clean** — bitmap set/clear + BGDT/SB accounting symmetry proven. QEMU gate (no iron). **Next: W3** (`ext2_write_at` + truncate).

### Added — W3 file-data write + sparse allocation + truncate (`ext2.cyr`)

The bite where the allocators start doing real file work — the mutating siblings of `ext2_read_at` / `ext2_logical_to_physical`.

- **`ext2_bmap_alloc(inode_buf, lblk)`** — logical→physical with **allocation**: returns the data block, allocating it (and the single-indirect block, born + zeroed + linked, when needed) if absent. Covers **direct + single-indirect** (files to ~4 MB on 4K blocks — every base-stage file); double/triple-indirect allocation deferred (read path still reads all levels). Tracks blocks-allocated (for i_blocks) + a was-new flag (zero-vs-RMW on partial writes).
- **`ext2_write_at(inode_num, offset, src, len)`** — writes bytes at any offset, allocating blocks on demand; sparse holes between old EOF and offset stay holes (pointer 0, read-zero-filled). Full-block overwrite skips the read; partial write to a new block zero-fills first, to an existing block read-modify-writes. Grows `i_size`; bumps `i_blocks` by allocated-blocks × sectors-per-block (the 512-B-sector accounting). `put_inode` persists last (doc § 3 ordering — data before pointer/size).
- **`ext2_truncate_zero(inode_num)`** — frees all data blocks (direct + single-indirect) + the indirect block, clears the pointers, zeroes `i_size`/`i_blocks`. Refuses on double/triple-indirect files (never created by this driver).

**Verification**: production **648,016 B** (+7,168). No regression (`ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5). **W3 smoke PASS**: overwrite /hello.txt @0 with 200 bytes → in-AGNOS readback byte-identical; sparse-write 100 bytes @8192 of /etc/hostname → new direct block allocated, block 1 a hole, readback identical, `i_blocks` +8; truncate /hello.txt → block freed, reads 0. **`e2fsck -fn` clean**; host `debugfs` confirms on disk: /etc/hostname `Size: 8292` (write+sparse landed), /hello.txt `Size: 0` (truncate landed). QEMU gate (no iron). **Next: W4** (dirent insert/remove + `create`/`unlink` + VFS arms).

### Added — W4a directory mutation + create/unlink (`ext2.cyr`)

The demo→base milestone at the FS layer: files can be created, written, **persisted**, and deleted. Dirent ops per the prior-art doc § 7 (FreeBSD `ext2_direnter`/`ext2_dirremove`).

- **`ext2_dir_insert`** — places a dirent by reusing a tombstone (inode 0) whose `rec_len` fits, or splitting a live entry's slack (`rec_len` beyond its real `round4(8+name_len)` size); appends a fresh direct dir block when no block has room. **`ext2_dir_remove`** — coalesces the victim's `rec_len` into the previous entry, or tombstones the block head. Helpers `ext2_round4`, `ext2_dirent_write`, `ext2_dir_try_insert`. Linear directories only (we never create htree-indexed dirs; smoke image is `-O ^dir_index`).
- **`ext2_create(dir, name)`** — alloc inode → init (S_IFREG | 0644, links 1, zeroed) → insert dirent; rolls back the inode if the dirent insert fails. **`ext2_unlink(dir, name)`** — remove dirent → dec links → at 0, set `i_dtime` + truncate + free inode. Refuses directories (rmdir is W5).
- **The `e2fsck` gate caught two real unlink bugs** (the point of the gate, per doc § 3): (1) a freed inode with `i_dtime == 0` trips *"Deleted inode N has zero dtime"* — so unlink now stamps `i_dtime` at links→0; (2) a *small* `i_dtime` (e.g. 1) is misread as an orphan-list next-inode pointer (the orphan chain is threaded through `i_dtime`) → *"corrupted orphan linked list"* — so the stamp is a timestamp-shaped value (`1748000000`, > any inode number), which can't be a next-pointer. No RTC, so it's a fixed sentinel; e2fsck checks `dtime != 0` + plausibility, not the value.

**Verification**: production **654,384 B** (+6,368). No regression (`ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5). **W4a smoke PASS**: `create("/w4keep.txt")` + write "AGNOS-W4-WROTE" → in-AGNOS lookup+readback match; `create("/w4tmp.txt")` + write + `unlink` → lookup gone, free-counts return to baseline. **`e2fsck -fn` clean**; host `debugfs` reads `/w4keep.txt` = "AGNOS-W4-WROTE" off the disk image (create+write+dirent **persisted**) and confirms `/w4tmp.txt` **absent** (unlink persisted). QEMU gate (no iron). **Next: W5 FS layer** (mkdir/rmdir), then the user-facing glue (VFS write arm + shell verbs) + iron burn.

### Added — W5 mkdir/rmdir (`ext2.cyr`) — FS-layer write surface complete

- **`ext2_mkdir(parent, name)`** — alloc dir inode (bumps `bg_used_dirs_count`), seed one data block with `.` (self) + `..` (parent), `links_count` 2, link into parent, and bump the parent's `links_count` (the new dir's `..` references it). Rolls back inode+block if the parent insert fails.
- **`ext2_rmdir(parent, name)`** — refuses non-empty dirs (`ext2_dir_is_empty` walks for any entry beyond `.`/`..`) and non-directories; removes the parent entry, drops the parent's link, truncates + frees the dir.
- This completes the ext2 mutation set at the FS layer: **create, write (+sparse +truncate), unlink, mkdir, rmdir** — every op e2fsck-clean.

**Verification**: production **659,408 B** (+5,024). No regression (`ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5). **W5 smoke PASS**: `mkdir /w5keep` → in-AGNOS lookup finds it, it's a directory, root `links_count` +1; rmdir round-trip (`mkdir /w5tmp` → `create` a file in it → `rmdir` **refused** non-empty → `unlink` the file → `rmdir` succeeds) → free-counts + parent link + lookup all return to baseline. **`e2fsck -fn` clean** — Pass 4 validates the mkdir/rmdir link accounting; host `debugfs` confirms `/w5keep` is a `directory` on disk (mkdir persisted) and `/w5tmp` **absent** (rmdir persisted). QEMU gate (no iron). **Next: the user-facing glue** — VFS write arm (`vfs_write` for `VFS_EXT2_FILE` + `vfs_create`) + shell `touch`/`echo>`/`rm`/`mkdir`/`rmdir` (interactive/iron-validated, not headless-smokeable) + `s_state` dirty/clean + the W5 iron burn.

### Added — W4b VFS write arm + shell write verbs (`vfs.cyr`, `shell.cyr`, `main.cyr`)

The user-facing surface — `echo hello > /f` works end-to-end.

- **`vfs_write` EXT2 arm** (`vfs.cyr`) — writes at the slot's position via `ext2_write_at`, advances pos, grows the cached size. Mirror of the existing `VFS_EXT2_FILE` read arm.
- **Shell verbs** (`shell.cyr`) — `touch`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, and `echo TEXT > FILE` redirect (create-or-truncate then write via the VFS arm). Path helpers `sh_abspath` (absolute or CWD-relative → `sh_path_buf`) + `sh_split_parent` (→ parent dir inode + basename, the shape `ext2_create`/`unlink`/`mkdir`/`rmdir` consume) + `sh_trim`.
- **Headless validation via `sh_exec`** — the interactive line reader is HID-driven (not driveable in a headless QEMU), so a compile-gated `sh_write_selftest` (`main.cyr`, after `ext2_write_selftest`) drives the *real* verb path with canned commands: `mkdir /shdir` → `echo SHELL-WROTE-IT > /shdir/keep.txt` → `cat /shdir/keep.txt` → `touch /shtmp` → `rm /shtmp`.

**Verification**: production **666,840 B** (+7,432). No regression (`ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 — all backends still reach the shell). **W4b smoke PASS**: the canned `cat` prints **"SHELL-WROTE-IT"** back (echo-redirect created the file + wrote it through the VFS arm, cat read it); **`e2fsck -fn` clean**; host `debugfs` reads `/shdir/keep.txt` = "SHELL-WROTE-IT" off the disk image and confirms `/shtmp` **absent**. **`echo > /f` → reboot → `cat /f` now works at the QEMU level** — the demo→base experience. **Next: the W5 iron burn** (the agnos-fs partition must be re-carved write-friendly first — `mkfs` with `^metadata_csum,^64bit`, since the current `mkfs.ext4`-default partition refuses write by design via the W2 write-safety gate).

### Fixed — `kprint` byte-length corrections (release cleanup, 5 sites)

`kprint`/`kprintln` take an explicit byte length; five literals had the wrong count (surfaced by a length-vs-literal audit during the cut). Four over-read by one (printing a stray trailing byte), one under-read (dropping a char):
- `ext2.cyr` `"ext2: log_block_size out of range: "` 36 → 35 (over-read; rare error path)
- `main.cyr` `"IOMMU: VT-d enabled, DMA restricted"` 36 → 35; `"Net: 10.0.2.15/24 gw 10.0.2.2"` 30 → 29 (over-read)
- `main.cyr` `"Creating test processes..."` 25 → 26 (under-read — was printing `…processes..`, dropping the third dot)
- `shell.cyr` `"=== done ==="` 13 → 12 (over-read, `bench` output)

## [1.32.9] — 2026-05-25 (DHCP re-enablement — the 1.32.3 STATIC bypass is removed and a real DHCP exchange runs again on boot. The OFFER timeout that drove the bypass across the 1.32.x arc was the r8169 unicast-RX drop **fixed at 1.32.7** (RX ring 16→64), not a DHCP-layer bug; with unicast RX delivering on iron, `dhcp_init()` can complete DISCOVER → OFFER → REQUEST → ACK. STATIC (192.168.1.222) stays as the iron fallback so a DHCP miss still leaves a usable address. QEMU/SLIRP DHCP exercised; iron verification is the next burn, user-driven.)

### Changed — boot net-probe re-attempts DHCP (`main.cyr`)

The 1.32.3 STATIC-IP bypass at the boot net-probe (`if (vnet_active != 0 || nic_ready() != 0)`) is removed. It existed only because DHCP's `OFFER timeout` looked like a DHCP bug — the 1.32.x arc proved it was the r8169 **unicast-RX delivery** drop (clean frames dropped for no free descriptor in a 16-deep ring), closed at 1.32.7 by deepening the RX ring 16→64. Both on-LAN and off-LAN unicast handshakes complete on iron at 1.32.7, so the unicast OFFER/ACK that DHCP needs now arrive. The probe now:

- **Seeds a STATIC iron fallback first** — `net_init(192.168.1.222 / 192.168.1.1 / 255.255.255.0)` on the iron path (`vnet_active == 0`) before the exchange, so a DHCP miss leaves a workable address (.222 is distinct from Linux's lease; the EEPROM hardware MAC claiming it draws gateway ARP replies even with Linux's lease active). QEMU keeps its `10.0.2.15` SLIRP fallback from the virtio branch.
- **Re-attempts `dhcp_init()`** — sends DISCOVER from `0.0.0.0`; on ACK it overwrites `net_ip`/`net_gateway`/`net_netmask` with the real lease (returns 0, printing `dhcp: ACK ip=…`); on timeout/NAK it returns nonzero, prints `net: DHCP failed -- using static fallback`, and the fallback stays in place.
- **Keeps the gateway ARP probe + L2-OK verdict** unchanged — it now targets whichever gateway we ended with (DHCP-leased or static fallback), caching the gateway MAC for off-LAN routing. The `NET_VERBOSE` `1.1.1.1:80` smoke + r8169 silicon tally readback (1.32.8) remain gated out of production.

No change to the r8169/eth/IP/UDP/DHCP-state-machine code — `dhcp_init()` (`net.cyr`) is unchanged from the 1.32.0 RFC 2131 implementation (BOOTREPLY op-gate, magic-cookie check, xid + chaddr match, 800-iter/~8 s OFFER+ACK windows with midpoint retransmit). This cut is purely the call-site re-enablement.

### Fixed — network-path logging printed base-16 values in decimal

Several net-path log lines used `kprint_num` (decimal) where the value is conventionally hex, so a gateway MAC rendered as `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` instead of `d4:6a:91:ce:70:60`, and a line literally labelled `byte=0x` printed a decimal number after the `0x`. Decimal `kprint_num` was simply the wrong formatter for those quantities. Added two framebuffer-visible hex printers in `kprint.cyr` — `kprint_byte(b)` (2-digit zero-padded, fb twin of the serial-only `kfmt_byte`) and `kprint_hex(n)` (variable-width, fb twin of `kfmt_hex`) — and routed every offending net-path site through them:

- **MAC octets → `kprint_byte`** at all four print sites: `main.cyr` `arp: REPLY gw_mac=…` (gateway MAC cached after the ARP probe) + `VirtIO-net: MAC=…` (QEMU enumerate), `r8169.cyr` `r8169: MAC=…` (iron NIC enumerate), and the `shell.cyr` `net` command's `MAC:` line.
- **r8169 MMIO/BAR base address → `kprint_hex`** — `r8169: found at <decimal>` now prints `r8169: found at 0x<hex>`.
- **r8169 chip-rev byte → `kprint_byte`** — `r8169: chip-rev byte=0x<decimal>` (the `0x` label contradicting a decimal value) now prints the actual hex byte.

IP addresses (the `net`/`tcp` dotted-quads, `dhcp_print_ip`) and the counter tallies (`r8169_print_stats`' `tx_ok`/`rx_ok`/`missed`/`rx_uc`/…) stay decimal — those are the correct base for each.

### Build

Production **623,816 B** (+552 B vs 1.32.8's 623,264 B — the DHCP call-site re-enable is ~+40 B; the rest is the two new `kprint_byte`/`kprint_hex` helpers + the six net-path logging-site swaps). `scripts/test.sh` **4/4** + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` **5/5** (all backends reach `AGNOS shell v` — no boot regression). multiboot2 ELF64 OK, entry `0x1000a8`. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD (production, no `NET_VERBOSE`). QEMU smoke harnesses carry no NIC, so they skip the net-probe block; **iron DHCP verification is the next burn (user-driven)** — expect `dhcp: DISCOVER` → `dhcp: OFFER ip=…` → `dhcp: REQUEST` → `dhcp: ACK ip=…` followed by `net: L2 OK -- gateway MAC cached`.

## [1.32.8] — 2026-05-25 (networking closeout cleanup — the 1.32.x r8169 unicast-RX arc is CONNECTED, so the per-burn diagnostics it accreted come out of the production boot: 1.1.1.1 outbound-TCP smoke + r8169 silicon tally readback gated behind `NET_VERBOSE`; the `.121` on-LAN-peer discriminator removed entirely; shell net commands `net`/`send`/`recv`/`tcp` de-hardcoded off QEMU SLIRP onto `nic_ready()` + the boot-configured gateway so they work on iron. DHCP re-enablement deferred to its own cycle **1.32.9**.)

### Changed — boot net diagnostics gated behind `NET_VERBOSE`

The 1.32.x unicast-RX arc closed at 1.32.7 (ring 16→64; both on-LAN and off-LAN TCP handshakes complete on iron). Its two instruments stay available for future debugging but are compiled out of the production boot, so the framebuffer now ends cleanly at `net: L2 OK -- gateway MAC cached`:

- **`1.1.1.1:80` outbound-TCP smoke** (`main.cyr` boot net-probe) — proves r8169 TX-to-gateway-MAC + off-LAN routing + unicast RX of the reply + the 3-way handshake. Now under `#ifdef NET_VERBOSE`.
- **r8169 silicon accept-counter readback** (`r8169_print_stats`, the `r8169: tx_ok=… rx_uc=… missed=…` line) — FreeBSD `re_sysctl_stats` / RTL8168 §6.8.4 tally DMA. Now under the same `#ifdef NET_VERBOSE`.

New `scripts/build.sh` gate `NET_VERBOSE=1` (same env-var prepend mechanism as `XHCI_VERBOSE` / `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE`), off by default. Rebuild with `NET_VERBOSE=1 sh scripts/build.sh` to re-confirm end-to-end connectivity on iron.

### Changed — shell net commands (`net`/`send`/`recv`/`tcp`) de-hardcoded for iron

These four commands gated on `vnet_active` (the virtio-only flag) and hardcoded QEMU SLIRP addresses (`10.0.2.15` / `10.0.2.2`), so on iron they printed `no network` despite the r8169 being up + connected, and re-`net_init`'d the working stack to bogus SLIRP values. Same wrong-flag class as the 1.32.0 DHCP gate fix (`main.cyr:671`). Now:

- **Gate** — all four use `if (vnet_active == 0 && nic_ready() == 0)` (the `nic_ready()` abstraction; works for virtio *and* r8169), matching the boot net-probe gate.
- **`net`** — prints the live configured `net_ip` (dotted quad) + the active NIC's MAC via `nic_mac()` instead of the hardcoded `IP: 10.0.2.15` / `vnet_mac`.
- **`send` / `recv`** — dropped the SLIRP `net_init` clobber (the boot net-probe already configured the stack); `send` targets `net_gateway`.
- **`tcp`** — dropped the SLIRP `net_init`; connects to the configured `net_gateway:80` and prints the resolved gateway address.

No `net_init` re-init in any of them — the boot net-probe owns the stack config. Iron behavior to be verified on the next burn (user-driven).

### Removed — `.121` on-LAN-peer discriminator scaffolding (1.32.7 bite-2)

The on-LAN unicast-TCP discriminator was the one-off instrument that proved the unicast-RX drop was general (not gateway-specific) at an owned, logged endpoint. It required the `mbp-lan-probe` harness broadcasting during boot and is not reproducible without it, so it is removed entirely rather than gated:

- `net.cyr`: `net_peer_ip` / `net_peer_mac` / `net_peer_mac_valid` slots, the `route_next_hop_mac` on-LAN-peer branch, and the `net_handle_arp` broadcast-snoop capture block (the `requester_ip` computation stays — it builds the ARP reply target fields).
- `main.cyr`: the ~2 s peer-wait, the `tcp: connect on-LAN …` / `net: LAN-TCP OK|FAIL` block, and the `net: no on-LAN peer` fallback line.

### Build

Production **623,264 B** (−1,224 B vs 1.32.7's 624,488 B — net of removed `.121` scaffolding + gated-out boot diagnostics, partly offset by the de-hardcoded shell `net`/`tcp` address-formatting). `NET_VERBOSE=1` build **623,648 B** (+384 B, the gated boot-probe path compiles). `scripts/test.sh` **4/4** + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` **5/5** (all backends reach shell — no boot regression). multiboot2 ELF64 OK, entry `0x1000a8`. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD (production, no `NET_VERBOSE`). The **boot-to-shell path is behaviorally unchanged** vs the iron-validated 1.32.7 (only diagnostics removed/gated — no change to the NIC/RX/TX/filter path), so no boot-regression risk. The **shell `net`/`send`/`recv`/`tcp` command changes are interactive-only** (not on the boot path) and are to be verified on the next iron burn (user-driven).

## [1.32.7] — 2026-05-25 (r8169 RX — bite-1/2 BURNED→FALSIFIED for the filter; **bite-3 silicon accept-counter readback RESOLVES the filter-vs-delivery split: `rx_uc>0` proves the MAC ACCEPTS unicast → the entire L2 accept/filter arc is CLOSED; the blocker is RX ring/poll DELIVERY**; bite-4 whole-ring drain BURNED→FALSIFIED (`missed` 158→176 UP — a 64-frame drain can't exceed the 16 descriptors that exist); 🎯 **bite-5 deepen RX ring 16→64 BURNED → CONNECTED: `missed` collapsed 176→0, both `net: LAN-TCP OK` (on-LAN) and `net: L3+TCP OK` (off-LAN via gateway) on iron — the 1.32.x r8169 unicast-RX arc is CLOSED, MVP on-iron networking blocker cleared**)

### Context

1.32.6 proved **gateway L2 reachability** on iron (RFC-826 ARP sender-snoop), but the gateway's unicast ARP reply and the TCP SYN+ACK — both unicast frames to AGNOS's MAC — still never arrive (`net: L3+TCP FAIL -- SYN sent but no SYN+ACK`). Arc-wide signature: broadcast + multicast deliver; unicast (physical-match) never has.

Decisive reframe: broadcast + multicast both ride the **MAR multicast-hash register** (`MAR=all-1s`; `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` falls in the all-1s hash bucket) — a register that latches fine pre-enable. So every "RX works" result has only ever exercised the MAR-hash path; the **IDR physical-match path has never delivered a single frame on iron**, and unicast-to-our-MAC is the only class that must transit it.

bite-7 (1.32.5) proved this stepping **silently drops filter-config writes issued while RX is disabled** (Linux commit `05212ba8132b`, for RxConfig) — the accept nibble only engaged once re-asserted *after* `CR.RE`. The IDR (the physical-match filter source) is the **lone remaining filter register still written ONLY pre-`CR.RE`**. 1.32.6 bite-2 reordered that pre-enable IDR write to `rtl_rar_set` shape, burned FALSIFIED, and declared the IDR filter "exonerated" — but it never moved the write past `CR.RE`, so that verdict is **CONFOUNDED exactly like the pre-enable AAP (Attempt 104) and CPlusCmd (1.32.6 bite-6) burns were**: every IDR write tested to date ran while RX was disabled.

### Fixed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` IDR physical-match filter re-asserted post-`CR.RE` (step 11c)

- After `CR.TE|RE` rises and the accept nibble is re-asserted (step 11b), **re-write IDR0/IDR4** — Cfg9346-unlock (datasheet §2.9 gates IDR writes), high half + readback commit, low half + readback commit, lock — mirroring the proven step-11b post-enable shape. The low-word write latches the 6-byte physical-match filter against AGNOS's MAC; if pre-enable IDR writes are dropped on this stepping (as RxConfig writes provably are), this is the write that finally lands the unicast filter. Reuses the `mac_lo`/`mac_hi` assembled in step 2.
- **Bisector role**: if the gateway's unicast ARP reply / SYN+ACK now lands → the pre-enable IDR write was the dropped lever. If unicast STILL drops → the accept+filter layer is genuinely exonerated (not confounded this time), the bug is below it, and the next escape is the hardware `rx_ucasts` tally counter (reg `0x28`) — instrumentation, deferred per [[feedback_no_instrumentation_means_no_instrumentation]] until this last behavioral lever is spent.

Build 622,560 B (1.32.6) → **622,656 B** (+96 B, post-enable IDR re-assert). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (all backends reach shell — no boot regression; r8169 path is iron-only, QEMU uses virtio_net). multiboot2 ELF64 OK. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD. NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — the next burn tests it. Rubric: FB reads `net: L3+TCP OK -- outbound TCP handshake established`, or at minimum the gateway's unicast ARP reply clears `arp_pending` via the *unicast* path (not the broadcast snoop).

### Burned (bite-1) — 2026-05-25 → FALSIFIED

🔥 `1327_TCP_Failure.jpg`. FB byte-identical to the bite-4/6 burns: `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` → `net: L2 OK -- gateway MAC cached` → `tcp: connect 1.1.1.1:80` → `net: L3+TCP FAIL -- SYN sent but no SYN+ACK`. The bisector's falsification branch fired: the post-enable IDR write is **not** the lever. **The entire L2 accept/filter layer is now genuinely exonerated** — accept nibble, AAP, CPlusCmd `Normal_mode`, and the IDR physical-match write have all been re-asserted post-`CR.RE` and unicast still drops. The defect is **below** the accept/filter layer.

### Fixed — bite-2: on-LAN unicast-TCP discriminator (`net.cyr` + `main.cyr`)

Rather than jump straight to the `rx_ucasts` tally instrumentation, run a **behavioral** discriminator first (user direction 2026-05-25) that splits **raw unicast RX** from **gateway/off-LAN routing** — the one thing every 1.1.1.1 burn has conflated.

- `net.cyr`: new `net_peer_ip` / `net_peer_mac` / `net_peer_mac_valid` slots. `net_handle_arp` captures a **non-gateway** host that ARP-probes us (`who-has net_ip`) into them — from the host's **broadcast** who-has sender fields (RFC 826), so the peer is learned with **zero unicast RX**, exactly like the gateway. `route_next_hop_mac` resolves on-LAN traffic to the peer (previously only the gateway was resolvable on-LAN).
- `main.cyr`: after `net: L2 OK`, a ~2 s peer-wait, then `tcp: connect on-LAN <peer>:80` → `net: LAN-TCP OK` / `net: LAN-TCP FAIL`, printed **before** the existing 1.1.1.1 test. The peer's SYN+ACK is the first unicast frame AGNOS must RX, on the same L2 segment (no gateway, no NAT), from an endpoint we own and log.
- Harness: `agnosticos/scripts/wire-probe/mbp-arp-rx-probe.sh` rewritten from the ARP-injection probe into a logging on-LAN TCP webservice — a `:80` listener (so the MBP kernel auto-SYN+ACKs and a completed handshake is logged), pcap capture, an ARP stimulus that doubles as AGNOS's peer-discovery signal, and a pcap+log verdict. Run on the `.121` MBP during the burn.

Build 622,656 → **623,928 B** (+1,272 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (zero regression). multiboot2 ELF64 OK. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD. VERSION untouched (1.32.7 open). NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. **Discriminator rubric**: `net: LAN-TCP OK` (+ MBP `ACCEPTED` log) → raw unicast RX **works** and the 1.1.1.1 failure is **gateway/off-LAN-specific** (major re-scope); `net: LAN-TCP FAIL` (MBP pcap shows SYN-in + SYN+ACK-out, no AGNOS ACK) → unicast-RX drop **confirmed at an owned, logged endpoint** with no gateway/NAT/Cloudflare in the path → the `rx_ucasts` hardware tally (reg `0x28`) instrumentation is then justified.

### Burned (bite-2) — 2026-05-25 → unicast-RX drop CONFIRMED at an owned, logged endpoint

🔥 `1327_dual_tcp_tests_failing.jpg` + MBP `tcpdump`. FB: `tcp: connect on-LAN 192.168.1.121:80` → `net: LAN-TCP FAIL`, then `1.1.1.1` → `net: L3+TCP FAIL`. The MBP capture proves the chain on the same L2 segment: AGNOS auto-discovered `.121` from its broadcast who-has, TX'd the on-LAN SYN, the MBP kernel SYN+ACK'd it **and retransmitted** — AGNOS never ACK'd. On-LAN and off-LAN unicast SYN+ACK drop identically ⇒ the drop is **general**, not gateway/off-LAN-specific; the re-scope-to-routing branch is ruled out. The `rx_ucasts` hardware tally is now justified → bite-3.

### Fixed — bite-3: r8169 silicon accept-counter readback (`main.cyr` boot net-probe)

Wire in the already-written, never-called `r8169_print_stats` / `r8169_dump_stats` (`r8169.cyr`, FreeBSD `re_sysctl_stats` / RTL8168 §6.8.4 tally-counter DMA), guarded `if (r8169_present == 1)` after both handshakes. Reads the chip's OWN silicon counters split by frame class — `rx_uc` (unicast accepted via physical-match), `rx_bc`, `rx_mc`. No new instrumentation authored; settles the filter-vs-delivery question the inference-only burns could not. Build 623,928 → **623,976 B** (+48 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (iron-only; QEMU output byte-identical to bite-2). multiboot2 ELF64 OK.

### Burned (bite-3) — 2026-05-25 → `rx_uc=2`: FILTER ACCEPTS UNICAST, THE RING DROPS IT

🔥 `1327_r8169_line.jpg`. FB trailing line: `r8169: tx_ok=5 rx_ok=140 tx_err=0 rx_err=0 missed=158 align=0 rx_uc=2 rx_bc=82 rx_mc=64`. **`rx_uc=2` > 0 → the chip's own silicon counted unicast frames ACCEPTED by the physical-match filter** — the entire L2 accept/filter arc (accept nibble + AAP + CPlusCmd `Normal_mode` + IDR physical-match) is closed by hardware, not inference. The blocker is **RX ring/poll delivery**: `missed=158` (RxMissed = RX-FIFO overflow, no host descriptor free) with `rx_err=0 align=0` (clean frames) means the ring drops more than half of received traffic for lack of a free descriptor — the unicast SYN+ACK dies there. `r8169_poll` returns after one good frame per call (`r8169.cyr:804`); the convergent next bite is to **drain the whole RX ring per poll call** (FreeBSD `re_rxeof` / iPXE `realtek_poll`).

### Fixed — bite-4: whole-ring drain per `net_poll` call (`net.cyr`)

`net_poll` pulled ONE frame per call and `tcp_connect` polls `net_poll(); arch_wait();` ×200 (one frame drained per `hlt` tick), so a LAN-chatter burst overran the 16-deep ring between ticks → FIFO overflow → the unicast SYN+ACK dropped before it was read. Rewrote `net_poll` into a bounded drain loop (`budget=64`): pull→dispatch each frame, malformed frames skip dispatch but keep draining, stop when the ring is empty. **Read path verified sound first** (`tcp_find_conn` 4-tuple match + `net_handle_tcp` SYN+ACK ack-validation correct) — purely a delivery fix. No filter/ring-size change. Build 623,976 → **624,056 B** (+80 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5. multiboot2 ELF64 OK. (commit `4c8e972`)

### Burned (bite-4) — 2026-05-25 → FALSIFIED (`missed` rose 158 → 176)

🔥 `1327_TCP_FAIL_Again.jpg`, this time with the on-LAN MBP peer up + the user's controlled pcap/server-log verdict (`agnos-lan-probe-20260525-155754`). FB: `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` → `net: L2 OK` → `tcp: connect on-LAN 192.168.1.121:80` → `net: LAN-TCP FAIL` → `tcp: connect 1.1.1.1:80` → `net: L3+TCP FAIL`; trailing `r8169: tx_ok=9 rx_ok=144 tx_err=0 rx_err=0 missed=176 align=0 rx_uc=5 rx_bc=74 rx_mc=65`. **The rubric's "`missed` stays high" branch fired — it went 158 → 176 (UP).** The drain loop alone can't relieve starvation: a 64-frame drain budget can only pull the **16 descriptors that physically exist**, so a burst between `hlt`-spaced polls still overflows. The user's probe is dispositive — at an endpoint we own and log, no gateway/NAT/Cloudflare: AGNOS sent the SYN, our kernel sent SYN+ACK to AGNOS's MAC, AGNOS never ACK'd (`UNICAST RX of SYN+ACK : 0`). ⇒ the pre-committed deepen-the-ring lever is the fix.

### Fixed — bite-5: deepen the RX ring 16 → 64 (`kernel/core/r8169.cyr`)

The bite-4-rubric pre-committed lever. bite-4 proved the bottleneck is **ring capacity, not servicing logic** — and 16 descriptors was an outlier vs all prior art (Linux `NUM_RX_DESC=256`, FreeBSD/OpenBSD 256). A LAN-chatter burst (74 bcast + 65 mcast in the probe window) overruns a 16-deep ring within one `hlt`-spaced poll gap, dropping the clean unicast SYN+ACK for lack of a free descriptor (`missed=176`, `rx_err=0 align=0`; silicon `rx_uc=5` already proved the filter accepts it).

- `R8169_RX_RING_SIZE` 16 → **64** — 4× burst headroom; 64×16 = 1024 B still fits one 4 KB ring page.
- Shared `R8169_RING_MASK` (0x0F) split into `R8169_RX_RING_MASK` (0x3F) + `R8169_TX_RING_MASK` (0x0F) — the rings now differ in depth.
- `r8169_rx_bufs[16]` → `[64]`; `r8169_init_rx` loop bound + EOR-slot keyed to `R8169_RX_RING_SIZE`; `r8169_poll` error-skip walk budget 16 → `R8169_RX_RING_SIZE`.
- **TX untouched** (tx_err=0, never overflowed) — stays 16. No filter/driver-config change, RX buffering depth only — keeps the deepen-ring result unconfounded against the (now-landed) drain loop.

Build 624,056 → **624,488 B** (+432 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (all 5 backends reach shell — zero regression; r8169 path is iron-only, QEMU uses virtio_net). multiboot2 ELF64 OK. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD. VERSION untouched (1.32.7 open). NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. **Rubric**: trailing `r8169: … missed=N …` — `missed` collapses toward 0 ⇒ the deeper ring absorbed the burst (+ `net: LAN-TCP OK` if the MBP peer is up = the win). If `missed` stays high at depth 64 ⇒ the drop is NOT a connect-window overflow → re-baseline to chip-side delivery (below the ring) or `tcp_connect` poll-cadence (tighten the post-SYN loop, drop the `arch_wait` gap).

### Burned (bite-5) — 2026-05-25 → 🎯 CONNECTED. THE 1.32.x r8169 UNICAST-RX ARC IS CLOSED.

🔥 `1327_CONNECTED.jpg`. **The rubric's win branch fired — `missed` collapsed 176 → 0.** FB: `net: STATIC ip=192.168.1.222 gw=192.168.1.1` → `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` → `net: L2 OK -- gateway MAC cached` → `tcp: connect on-LAN 192.168.1.121:80` → **`net: LAN-TCP OK -- on-LAN unicast handshake established`** → `tcp: connect 1.1.1.1:80` → **`net: L3+TCP OK -- outbound TCP handshake established`** → trailing `r8169: tx_ok=21 rx_ok=103 tx_err=0 rx_err=0 missed=0 align=0 rx_uc=10 rx_bc=47 rx_mc=46` → `AGNOS shell v1.32.7`.

**Both** the on-LAN MBP-peer SYN+ACK (the first unicast frame from an endpoint we own + log, same L2 segment, no gateway/NAT) **and** the off-LAN 1.1.1.1 handshake through the gateway read cleanly — `missed=0` proves the 64-deep ring absorbed the LAN-chatter burst that overran the 16-deep ring at bite-4 (`missed=176`). The unicast-RX defect was **RX ring DELIVERY CAPACITY all along**: bite-3 exonerated the filter (silicon `rx_uc`>0), bite-4 isolated the constraint to capacity (a drain budget can't exceed the 16 descriptors that physically exist), bite-5 fixed it. 16 was the outlier vs all prior art (Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD 256).

The 1.32.x r8169 unicast-RX arc (1.32.0 → 1.32.7, opened 2026-05-22) is **CLOSED** — TX, broadcast/multicast RX, L2 gateway reachability, and now unicast RX (on-LAN *and* off-LAN) are all proven on archaemenid. **The MVP on-iron networking blocker is cleared.** Photo catalogued at `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/1327-agnos-1.32.7-bite5-rx-ring-16-to-64-connected-…jpg`; full arc narrative in `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1327-cycle`.

**1.32.8 (next, cleanup)**: gate the `1.1.1.1:80` probe behind a verbose flag and remove the `.121` on-LAN-peer discriminator scaffolding (`net_peer_*` slots, the `main.cyr` peer-wait + on-LAN `tcp_connect`, the MBP harness) — both were diagnostic instruments for this arc, now spent.

## [1.32.6] — 2026-05-25 (r8169 RX — **gateway L2 reachability PROVEN on iron** via RFC-826 ARP sender-snoop; CPlusCmd `Normal_mode` restored; unicast-class TCP RX carries to 1.32.7)

### Context

1.32.5 proved broadcast + multicast RX on iron (bite-7 + the FB self-test); the gateway's *unicast* ARP reply stayed unseen. A from-scratch re-derive of the unicast accept path **falsified its leading hypothesis** — that bite H (1.32.3) had removed the post-reset IDR0-5 write-back. Reading the code (not the narrative, per [[feedback_audit_re_derive_dont_validate_comments]]): the write-back is **present and correct**, Cfg9346-wrapped at `r8169.cyr:520-534`, matching Linux `rtl_rar_set` — it was already in the burned 1.32.5 build. Full zero-burn audit:

- **IDR0-5 write-back** (the APM unicast-filter source) — present, correct, Cfg9346-wrapped.
- **Accept nibble `AAP|AB|AM|APM` (`0x0F`)** — written pre-`CR.RE` AND re-asserted post-`CR.RE` (bite-7). Both unicast (APM, bit 1) and promiscuous (AAP, bit 0) are set, so a unicast frame to our MAC must pass the chip's L2 filter.
- **`net_handle_arp` reply path** (`net.cyr:556-564`) — opcode read big-endian; `sender_ip` and `arp_pending_ip` are both host-ints assembled from the same byte order, so a matching reply WOULD clear the pending request. No software bug.

The accept path is fully convergent and the software path is clean. The one real divergence from all prior-art (Linux `neigh`, iPXE, lwIP `etharp`, *BSD): **AGNOS sent exactly one ARP request and never retransmitted.**

### Added — `kernel/core/main.cyr` ARP request retransmit (RFC 1122 §2.3.2.1)

- **Re-send the gateway ARP request ~1×/sec across the 5 s probe window** while `arp_pending_ip` stays set (`main.cyr:684-713` region). A single request that is missed or not yet elicited otherwise times out the whole window with no retry — and ARP replies are only sent in response to a request, so a missed first reply is never re-offered. 4 retransmits across the window (initial + @100/200/300/400 ticks on the 100 Hz timer). No per-retransmit FB print (functional fix, not instrumentation).
- **Discriminator role**: next burn sees `arp: REPLY` → the failure was a transient/elicitation miss; still times out → the unicast drop is systematic, and the deep driver APM re-derive (multi-source) is queued as 1.32.6 bite 2.

Build 622,408 B (1.32.5) → **622,560 B** (+152 B, retransmit loop). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5. multiboot2 ELF64 OK. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD. NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — the next burn tests it.

### bite 2 — deep driver APM re-derive: `rtl_rar_set` order + posted-write flush

The LX2 burn (`1326_LX2_Still_No_Gate.jpg`) fired the discriminator's **systematic** branch: FB read `net: L2 RX ALIVE rx=15 arp_in=11 arp_ans=2 -- gateway unicast reply pending`. `arp_ans=2` proves the retransmit loop egressed (AGNOS answered 2 inbound who-has-`.222` queries), `arp_in=11` proves the RX ring delivered 11 broadcast ARP frames — yet the gateway's *unicast* reply never cleared `arp_pending_ip`. **The unicast drop is systematic, not a transient elicitation miss.**

Three parallel from-scratch re-derives (BSD triangle `if_re.c`/`re.c`/`rtl8169.c`; iPXE+Haiku+U-Boot; Linux `r8169_main.c` VER_46 + datasheet + erratum git-history) converged. Reconciled against AGNOS's actual code, the load-bearing reframe and the two divergences:

- **Reframe — broadcast/multicast delivery does NOT prove the accept nibble engages.** `MAR=all-1s` (allmulti) makes BROADCAST pass via the multicast hash (`ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` is the all-1s hash bucket), independent of the RxConfig accept bits. So "broadcast + multicast in" is consistent with the *entire accept nibble being inert* — and UNICAST (I/G bit clear) is the only class that must transit the physical-match (APM/AAP) path. Decisive corroboration: Linux commit `efa5f1311c49` (force-allmulti for VER_46 unicast) was **reverted** (`6a26310273c3`) after the maintainer replayed the exact unicast frame to the exact MAC on the exact chip and it was received — so a *correctly-initialized* VER_46 receives unicast without allmulti. The symptom is an init-protocol bug, not a missing workaround.
- **Fix 1 — IDR write-back order + flush (`r8169.cyr:520-540`).** The write-back was present and at the right location, but the *protocol* diverged from Linux `rtl_rar_set` (`r8169_main.c:2559-2573`): AGNOS wrote IDR0 (low half) first, IDR4 (high half) second, with no readback between. Linux writes **MAC4 (high) first, `rtl_pci_commit` readback, then MAC0 (low), readback** — the low-word write latches the 6-byte physical-match filter, so the high two bytes must already be resident, and the readback prevents posted-write reordering on fast PCIe from latching a torn address. A torn unicast filter drops the gateway's unicast reply while broadcast (no IDR consult) + multicast (MAR hash) still pass — the exact iron signature. Reordered to high-first with a flush after each write.
- **Fix 2 — post-enable RxConfig clean full write (`r8169.cyr:660-668`).** Per Linux commit `05212ba8132b`, RxConfig writes issued while RX is *disabled* are silently dropped — so AGNOS's pre-`CR.RE` write was a no-op, and the post-`CR.RE` **read-modify-write** preserved whatever reset-value profile bits the readback returned, meaning the profile word (FIFOTHRESH | MAXDMA | EARLYOFFV2) may never have landed. Replaced the RMW with one clean full write of `RXCFG_DEFAULTS | accept` post-enable (mirroring Linux `rtl_init_rxcfg` + `rtl_set_rx_mode`, both called after `ChipCmd` enable in `rtl_hw_start:4124-4128`), followed by a readback commit.
- **Comment hygiene** — corrected the stale CPlusCmd block (`r8169.cyr:59-64`) that claimed `RXENB|TXENB` are "LOAD-BEARING"; the code (correctly, per the bite-6 correction) writes only `MULRW`. Per [[feedback_audit_re_derive_dont_validate_comments]].

Build 622,560 B (bite 1) → **622,544 B** (−16 B; RMW arithmetic removed, readback flushes + reorder added). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (all backends reach shell — no boot regression; r8169 path is iron-only, QEMU uses virtio_net). multiboot2 ELF64 OK. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects working tree. NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — the next burn tests it. Discriminator for the next burn: FB shows `arp: REPLY gw_mac=…` + `net: L2 OK` → the rar_set order/flush was load-bearing; still `reply pending` → unicast drop is below the accept+filter layer (next escape: the hardware tally-counter `rx_ucasts` readback at `0x28` to localize definitively, but that is instrumentation and stays deferred per [[feedback_no_instrumentation_means_no_instrumentation]] until the convergent behavioral levers are exhausted).

### bite 4 — REFRAME: gateway-MAC learning is an ARP-layer problem (RFC 826 sender-snoop) — **the cycle's shipped win**

Per user direction (*"the driver works — it's ARP and DHCP"*), chasing "r8169 unicast-class RX delivery" was the wrong layer for *reachability*. `net_handle_arp` (`net.cyr:551`) learned the gateway MAC ONLY from a solicited unicast reply (`oper==2` matching the pending request) — violating RFC 826, which snoops sender IP→MAC from EVERY ARP frame. **Fix**: snoop the sender from any ARP frame (request OR reply), gated on `arp_pending_ip` (security posture unchanged). The Araknis gateway broadcasts its own `who-has` (sender=`.1`, mac=`d4:6a:91:ce:70:60`), which AGNOS already receives as BROADCAST → the gateway MAC is now learnable with **zero unicast RX**. Zero-burn validated on Linux (`scripts/dhcp-probe/src/arp_snoop_check.cyr`, AF_PACKET, NIC stays bound): a 15 s capture saw the gateway as ARP sender 10× broadcast + 5× unicast; the new snoop clears `arp_pending` from the broadcast frames the old reply-only code discarded.

**🎯 BURNED 2026-05-25 → gateway reachability PROVEN on iron — first time in the whole 1.32.x arc.** FB read `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` (= `d4:6a:91:ce:70:60`) → `net: L2 OK -- gateway MAC cached`, with zero unicast RX (snooped from the gateway's own broadcast). RFC-826 sender-snoop now proven on iron, not just Linux. Boot then walked into L3: `tcp: connect 1.1.1.1:80` → `net: L3+TCP FAIL -- SYN sent but no SYN+ACK` (the SYN+ACK is a unicast frame to AGNOS's MAC — the parked unicast-RX gap, now isolated as the sole live blocker). Photo: `iron-nuc-zen-photos/1326-agnos-1.32.6-arp-snoop-l2-ok-gateway-cached-tcp-syn-no-synack.jpg`.

### bite 5 — `agnos> test` output re-routed to the framebuffer

`sh_cmd_test` (`kernel/user/test.cyr`) ran the kernel suite (pmm/heap/vfs/proc/syscall/kstdlib/initrd) but emitted only via `serial_print`/`serial_println` → invisible on archaemenid (no serial cable, per [[feedback_no_serial_on_iron]]). Re-routed to `kprintln` so `agnos> test` produces visible PASS/FAIL on iron, converting the in-shell suite into a reusable iron testing surface (later extendable with net/ARP checks for interactive reachability re-runs).

### bite 6 — CPlusCmd `Normal_mode` (0x2000) restored — `0x0008` → `0x2061`; RxConfig accept `0x0F` → `0x0E`

An `ethtool -d enp1s0` dump of the LIVE WORKING Linux r8169 on this exact chip (VER_46) gave the proven config CPlusCmd=`0x2061`, RxConfig=`0x0002CF0E`. A 3-source agent audit (Linux `r8169_main.c` + FreeBSD `if_rlreg.h` + RTL8168 datasheet) killed the bit-17/RMW lead (Linux never authors it; FreeBSD blind-writes without it + RXes unicast) and pinned the lone source-confirmed, never-burned divergence to **CPlusCmd `Normal_mode` — AGNOS's bare `0x0008` (MULRW only) write had ZEROED the chip's power-on Normal_mode bit.** The prior CPlusCmd/profile A/B burns were CONFOUNDED — every one ran with Normal_mode cleared. Also dropped AAP from the accept nibble (`0x0F` → `0x0E` = AB|AM|APM) to match the working dump, which never sets promiscuous.

**🔥 BURNED 2026-05-25 (`1326_still_ack_issue.jpg`) → FALSIFIED for unicast.** FB byte-identical to the bite-4 burn: `arp: REPLY gw_mac=212:106:145:206:112:96` → `net: L2 OK` → `tcp: connect 1.1.1.1:80` → `net: L3+TCP FAIL -- SYN sent but no SYN+ACK`. Normal_mode is now correct **and stays** (it's the proven-Linux value), but it was NOT the unicast gate. **Branch retired**: with Normal_mode restored and the accept nibble matching the working dump, the surviving unicast-RX gap isolates to the one filter register never moved past `CR.RE` — the IDR physical-match write (→ 1.32.7).

### Cycle close

1.32.6 ships **gateway L2 reachability on iron** — the RFC-826 sender-snoop (bite 4) learns the gateway MAC from broadcast with zero unicast RX, the first gateway reachability across the entire 1.32.x networking arc. CPlusCmd `Normal_mode` (bite 6) is restored to the proven-Linux value. The **unicast-class RX residual** (gateway unicast ARP reply / TCP SYN+ACK still undelivered) carries to **1.32.7**, where the IDR physical-match filter is re-asserted post-`CR.RE` — the lever bite-2's confounded "exoneration" never tested. Burned bite-6 build 622,560 B. MVP gate stayed green on iron (boot-to-shell byte-clean). cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged.

## [1.32.5] — 2026-05-25 (r8169 RX — broadcast + multicast delivery PROVEN on iron; honest L2 RX self-test; unicast carries to next cycle)

### Cycle close

**The defining win: first inbound frame acted upon on iron in the entire 1.32.x networking arc.** After 7 falsified burns chasing "RX silent," the **post-RX-enable accept-filter re-assert (bite-7)** broke through — AGNOS received a broadcast ARP and egressed a correct unicast reply on the wire (`1325_pcap_attempt_4`), proving the full RX → `r8169_poll` → `net_poll` → `net_handle_arp` → reply-TX chain is healthy. The **honest L2 RX self-test** then surfaced that breakthrough on the framebuffer itself (`net: L2 RX ALIVE rx=10 arp_in=7 arp_ans=1`), retiring the "FB lied for 4 days" diagnostic defect. Broadcast + multicast RX are PROVEN; the cycle's stretch goal — **unicast (APM-class) RX delivery** — carries forward to the next cycle (leading bite: restore the post-reset IDR0-5 write-back that bite H removed, untried in combination with the now-working accept re-assert). Build **622,408 B**, cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged, `test.sh` 4/4 + `ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5, multiboot2 OK, MVP gate green on iron.

### Context

The `1324_tcp_capture.pcapng` burn (2026-05-24 ~18:55 PDT) closed the 1.32.4 TX-vs-RX disambiguator: AGNOS's broadcast ARP request egressed the wire byte-correct (`b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25 > ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff who-has 192.168.1.1 tell 192.168.1.222`), proving r8169 **TX works on iron**. The gateway's unicast reply was invisible from the capture vantage (a regular LAN host, not a SPAN/mirror port), so combined with Attempt 102's Linux proof (gateway unicast-replies to this exact frame, Linux RX delivers it) + the cross-era multicast-only RX signature (Attempts 97–103 delivered `01:00:5e` multicast only), the bug isolates to **r8169 RX dropping broadcast + unicast classes; multicast passes.** Since 2 KB RX buffers exceed the 1500 MTU, every accepted frame is single-descriptor — so the class-selective drop is at the chip's **L2 accept filter**, before the ring. Multi-source re-derivation (FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD `re_rxeof`/`re_set_rxmode`, iPXE `realtek.c`, Linux VER_46 erratum) at [`agnosticos/docs/development/r8169-rx-path-audit.md` § 1.32.5 addendum](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/r8169-rx-path-audit.md).

### Changed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` RX accept filter

- **Added AAP (accept-all-physical / promiscuous) to the RxConfig accept mask** — `accept = AAP | AB | AM | APM` (RxConfig `0xEF00 | 0x0F = 0xEF0F`, was `0xEF0E`). Matches iPXE `realtek_open`'s **unconditional** RCR low-nibble `0x0F`; iPXE is the pure-poll from-scratch DMA-ring analog that runs this chip family promiscuous-by-default for PXE/DHCP. On the RTL8168H stepping (mac_version 46) the per-address + broadcast accept path is known-quirky (Linux VER_46 erratum: "filters unicast eapol unless allmulti enabled"); AAP bypasses the L2 accept filter entirely so the broadcast OFFER + unicast ARP reply reach the ring. Also serves as a **bisector** — if RX still drops with AAP set, the fault is downstream of the filter. The BSDs gate ALLPHYS behind `IFF_PROMISC`; AAP-by-default is the iPXE bring-up convention, revisit at hardening.

### Fixed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` `r8169_poll`

- **Removed the unconditional FS|LS discard gate.** FreeBSD `re_rxeof` + OpenBSD `re_rxeof` gate the SOF|EOF requirement behind `RL_FLAG_JUMBOV2` only; iPXE `realtek_poll` checks OWN + RES only. For non-jumbo single-descriptor frames (our case — 2 KB buffers > MTU) every accepted frame has FS&LS both set, so the gate never fired for legit traffic but over-gated relative to all non-Linux prior art. OWN-bit handoff already guarantees frame completion when the chip clears OWN.

**Iron Attempt 104 (AAP build) BURNED 2026-05-24 ~19:58 PDT → FALSIFIED** — `arp: TIMEOUT` / `L1/L2 FAILED`. The AAP bisector fired its falsification branch: the L2 accept-mask is **EXONERATED**, the fault is downstream of the filter (descriptor OWN/DMA/ring delivery). `1325_pcap_test.pcapng` re-proved TX from a regular switched port (still wrong vantage for the gateway's unicast reply).

### Fixed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` RxMaxSize field overflow (FALSIFIED on iron)

- **RMS (0xDA) `0x4000` → `0x05F3`.** RxMaxSize is a 13–14-bit field on the 8168; `0x4000` sets bit 14 outside it. Hypothesis was "reads as RMS=0 → rejects all frames." **Burned 2026-05-24 (`1325_pcap_attempt_2.pcapng`) → FALSIFIED** — no change on iron, and the hypothesis is internally inconsistent with the multicast-passing evidence of Attempts 97–99 (RMS=0 would have dropped multicast too). The `0x05F3` value is correct and retained (admits full 1518-byte frames), but it was **not** the RX blocker. RMS candidate CLOSED.

### Fixed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` RX-engine bring-up (RXDV-gate settle + CPlusCmd) — multi-source re-derived, pending burn

Two convergent divergences found by re-deriving the 8168H (mac_version 46 / XID 541) RX-engine bring-up from authoritative sources (Linux `rtl_disable_rxdvgate` + `CPCMD_MASK`/`INTT_MASK`, FreeBSD `if_re.c`, OpenBSD `RL_FLAG_RXDV_GATED`, NetBSD, U-Boot, iPXE). The research first confirmed bite H was **correct** to delete the Linux ephy/ERI/MAC-OCP/firmware clone — FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD all drive this exact stepping to working RX with none of it — and isolated the one RX-datapath-load-bearing step buried in Linux's `rtl_hw_start_8168h_1`:

- **RXDV-gate settle (primary).** AGNOS already clears `RXDV_GATED_EN` (MISC 0xF0 bit 19) but enabled `CR.RE` microseconds later. Linux pairs the clear with `fsleep(2000)` (~2 ms); without the settle the RX validator opens *after* RX starts, so RX delivers nothing while TX (which never consults the gate) egresses fine — the exact iron signature. U-Boot clears this same bit specifically for *"DHCP failures after kernel reboots"*, precisely the archaemenid warm-boot-from-Linux scenario. Added a ~4–8 ms non-posted-MMIO-read spin (timer is 100 Hz / 10 ms-granular, too coarse) between the clear and `CR.RE`.
- **CPlusCmd correction (secondary).** `0x000B → 0x0008` (PCIMulRW only). The prior code OR'd in `0x0001|0x0002` believing them "C+ RX/TX enable" — that is the legacy 8139C+ map. On the gigabit 8168 those bits are the INTT interrupt-moderation timer select (Linux `INTT_MASK = GENMASK(1,0)`); FreeBSD only sets RXENB|TXENB on its `!MACSTAT` branch, which the 8168H is not. Inert under `IMR=0` (pure poll) but unambiguously wrong — and the exact "nine-burn CPlusCmd trap" flagged in [[feedback_audit_re_derive_dont_validate_comments]]. RX/TX are gated solely by `CR.RE|CR.TE`.

Build 621,704 B (Attempt 104) → **621,768 B** (+64 B, settle spin). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5. multiboot2 ELF64 OK. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. `build/agnos` reflects HEAD. **NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]** — the next burn TESTS these (no instrumentation added). Research receipts: [`r8169-rx-path-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/r8169-rx-path-audit.md) + [`iron-nuc-zen-log-mvp2.md#tracker-1325-cycle`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).

### Fixed — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` RX accept filter re-asserted after RX-enable (bite-7) — 🎯 BREAKTHROUGH on iron

- **Re-assert the RxConfig accept nibble (`AAP \| AB \| AM \| APM`) AFTER `CR.RE`, not only before it** (`r8169.cyr:639-664`). Every prior burn wrote the accept bits once, pre-enable. OpenBSD `re_iff`, Linux `rtl_set_rx_mode`, and iPXE all (re)program the accept filter at/after RX-enable — the lone untried convergent ordering, named as the escape lever in the `1325_pcap_attempt_3` ladder reckoning. Mechanism: multicast rides the separate MAR register (always landed) while broadcast/unicast/AAP live in the accept nibble, which the chip ignores when written before `CR.RE` — the exact multicast-passes / broadcast+unicast-drop split seen since Attempt 97.

**Iron burn `1325_pcap_attempt_4.pcapng` 2026-05-25 ~01:18 PDT → broadcast RX PROVEN on iron** (build 621,896 B). AGNOS received host `.121`'s broadcast ARP `who-has 192.168.1.222` and egressed a correct unicast reply (`01:18:57.527723 b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25 > 42:c2:df:db:ee:78 Reply 192.168.1.222 is-at b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25`) — the **first inbound frame acted upon on iron in the entire 1.32.x arc**. The full inbound chain ran end-to-end: r8169 RX → `r8169_poll` → `net_poll` → `net_handle_arp` (matched `target_ip == net_ip`) → reply TX. **This falsifies the Attempt-104 / bite-6 framing that the bug was in descriptor OWN/DMA/ring delivery — the ring delivers and the poll/dispatch/rearm path is healthy.** Remaining gap (narrowed, not closed): the boot self-test still printed its failed verdict because its sole gate is the gateway's *unicast* ARP reply, which is invisible at the capture vantage and a different L2 accept class (APM) than the broadcast (AB) now proven; **unicast-class RX delivery is still unconfirmed**. Receipt: [`iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § bite-7 breakthrough](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).

### Changed — `kernel/core/main.cyr` + `kernel/core/net.cyr` honest L2 RX self-test

- **The boot net self-test now reports what RX actually delivered instead of a flat pass/fail.** During the 5 s gateway-ARP-probe wait (`main.cyr:684-721`) it counts frames `net_poll()` handled (via its existing return code — no driver changes) and ARP replies the responder TX'd (`net_arp_replies_sent`, new counter at `net.cyr:592`). On a gateway-reply timeout it now prints `net: L2 RX ALIVE rx=N arp_in=M arp_ans=K -- gateway unicast reply pending` (RX is alive, only the gateway unicast round-trip is incomplete) or `net: L2 RX SILENT -- 0 frames in ~5s` (truly dead) — replacing the misleading flat `net: L1/L2 FAILED -- cannot reach gateway`. Motivated directly by `1325_pcap_attempt_4`: during the exact window the old verdict reported total L1/L2 failure, the same poll loop was receiving broadcast and answering ARP on the wire. The next burn will surface the breakthrough on the framebuffer without needing a pcap.

**Iron burn `1325-agnos-1.32.5-honest-l2-rx-selftest-rx-alive-on-fb.jpg` 2026-05-25 ~02:00 PDT → RX ALIVE confirmed on the framebuffer** (build 622,408 B, HEAD `52a66f8`). The FB read `net: L2 RX ALIVE rx=10 arp_in=7 arp_ans=1 -- gateway unicast reply pending` — 10 frames delivered, 7 inbound ARP, 1 reply TX'd by AGNOS — surfacing the bite-7 broadcast-RX breakthrough without a pcap and retiring the 4-day "FB lied" defect (a partial-RX NIC no longer reads identically to a dead one). `rx=10 > arp_in=7` means 3 non-ARP frames also delivered (other ethertypes), so broadcast **and** multicast classes pass; the lone remaining gap is the gateway's *unicast* (APM-class) reply, still pending. Leading next bite: restore the post-reset IDR0-5 write-back that bite H removed — broadcast (AB, IDR-independent) delivers while unicast (APM, IDR-dependent) does not, exactly the split a zeroed-IDR unicast filter predicts (the gateway is proven to unicast-reply to this exact MAC+IP frame on Linux, so gateway-silence is ruled out).

Build **622,408 B** (+512 B vs bite-7). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 + `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 (all 5 backends reached shell — the new boot-block prints compile and don't fault). multiboot2 ELF64 OK. cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged. NOT auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]].

## [1.32.4] — 2026-05-24 (networking iron-isolation cycle — opened on the DHCP-OFFER-downstream 10-bundle, pivoted to a STATIC-IP + ARP probe, CLOSED having PROVEN AGNOS frame construction wire-correct on Linux and ISOLATED the iron failure to r8169 RX delivery. The bug survives; the cycle's gain is the isolation + audit closure, not a green burn.)

### Context

Attempt 100 (1.32.3 close) unblocked the chip-level RX filter — first iron evidence across the 1.32.x arc that a broadcast frame can be admitted by the chip (CMOS `[0x5E]=0xff`, `[0x5D]=0x72` BAR bit). But `dhcp: OFFER timeout` still in FB → gate moves DOWNSTREAM of `r8169_poll`. Two macro candidates: (c1) admitted broadcast was NOT the DHCP OFFER (ARP / NetBIOS / mDNS / SSDP / Linux dhclient broadcast on same MAC), OR (c2) OFFER admitted but lost in AGNOS UDP/IP/DHCP receive path. Multi-source convergent audit (RFC 2131/2132/768 + Linux `ic_bootp_recv` + OpenBSD `dhcpleased` + FreeBSD/ISC `dhclient` + iPXE `dhcp_deliver` + Plan 9 `dhcpclient`) at [`agnosticos/docs/development/dhcp-offer-downstream-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/dhcp-offer-downstream-audit.md) identified 2 LOAD-BEARING absent validations in AGNOS `dhcp_init` OFFER matcher (BOOTP `op==2`, magic-cookie validation), 2 MEDIUM verifications (xid byte-order, options-walker invariants — **both audited OK this cycle, no code change**), and a (c1)/(c2) disambiguation path via finer-grained CMOS instrumentation + Linux-side `tcpdump`.

### 10-item bundle (per the audit's § 5-6 plan)

This cycle lands the bundle; the next iron burn validates against the rubric in audit § 6 + escape plan in § 7. NO new iron burn auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — user authorizes when ready.

#### Added — `kernel/core/net.cyr` `dhcp_init` OFFER matcher hardening (Items 3 + 4 = Fixes A + B)

- **Fix A — BOOTP `op == 2` (BOOTREPLY) gate** at the head of the OFFER match loop. RFC 2131 §4.1 mandatory; 5-of-5 reference sources enforce. One line: `if (load8(&rx + 0) != 2) { continue; }`. Without this, a looped-back DISCOVER (op=1) with the right xid would pass the matcher despite being structurally wrong.
- **Fix B — Magic cookie validation** at offset +236 in the OFFER match loop. 4 lines, byte-by-byte against `{0x63, 0x82, 0x53, 0x63}` (NEVER a `u32` literal compare — endianness trap per multi-source spec § 7). 4-of-5 reference sources validate (Linux / OpenBSD / FreeBSD / Plan 9; iPXE relies on TX-symmetry only).

#### Added — `kernel/core/net.cyr` `dhcp_init` ACK matcher mirror (Item 10)

Same two checks (BOOTP `op==2` + magic cookie) mirrored into the ACK match loop. Without these, post-REQUEST silent-drop has the same shape as the OFFER silent-drop the cycle's audit framed.

#### Added — CMOS instrumentation slots `[0x88..0x8C]` (Items 2 + 7) for the next iron burn's disambiguation

- `[0x88]` = last admitted-frame ethertype hi byte (offset +12). `0x08` = IPv4 or ARP plausible; `0xDD` IPv6; other = uncommon.
- `[0x89]` = last admitted-frame ethertype lo byte (offset +13). `0x00` = IPv4 → DHCP-plausible; `0x06` = ARP → (c1); `0xDD` = IPv6 → (c1).
- `[0x8A]` = if IPv4, IP proto (offset +14 + IHL bytes). `0x11` = UDP=17 → DHCP-plausible; `0x01` = ICMP; `0x06` = TCP; `0x02` = IGMP.
- `[0x8B]` = if UDP, UDP dst port low byte (offset +14 + IHL + 3). `0x44` = port 68 = DHCP-bound; `0x89` = 137 NetBIOS; `0xE9` = 5353 mDNS; `0x6C` = 1900 SSDP.
- `[0x8C]` = listener.state at the moment first UDP/68 frame is delivered to `net_handle_udp`. Confirms listener was bound BEFORE the OFFER frame arrived (escape plan step 2 instrumentation).

Stamps fire on every frame consumed (state-transition only, single store per slot per frame — no hot-path tax per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]] cycle's r8169 Part D shape from 1.32.3).

#### Added — `scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` reader rows for slots `[0x88..0x8C]`

Verbose `--verbose` mode prints decoded values + cheat-sheet inline. Same shape as the existing r8169 / xhci slot rows; pattern-match for one-glance correlation with FB-side `dhcp: OFFER timeout`.

#### Added — `DHCP_FRAME_DUMP` compile-gated full-frame dump to extended CMOS bank `[0x90..0xCF]` (Item 8)

When `cyrius build` invoked with `DHCP_FRAME_DUMP=1`, the first 64 bytes of the FIRST UDP/68 frame consumed post-DISCOVER are mirrored into CMOS slots `[0x90..0xCF]`. Off by default; engaged only if the next burn's `[0x88..0x8B]` shows `08, 00, 11, 44` (admitted frame IS UDP to port 68) AND `dhcp: OFFER timeout` still in FB — at which point we dump the actual frame bytes to confirm vs `tcpdump` capture.

#### Added — `DHCP_STATIC_IP` compile-gated static-IP fallback (Item 9)

When `cyrius build` invoked with `DHCP_STATIC_IP=1`, `dhcp_init` skips the full DHCP cycle and assigns `net_ip` / `net_gateway` / `net_netmask` from build-time constants. Unblocks downstream networking validation (TCP server reachability, REST endpoint testing) without depending on DHCP — escape-plan step 6 from the audit. Default constants suitable for archaemenid's LAN (192.168.1.X subnet); user can edit one constant block to retarget.

#### Audited — Items 5 (xid byte-order) + 6 (options walker) — NO CODE CHANGE NEEDED

- **Item 5 (Fix C — xid byte-order)**: `dhcp_init`'s TX builds xid via `dhcp_store_u32_be(buf+4, xid)` (BE bytes on wire), RX compares via `dhcp_load_u32_be(&rx+4) == dhcp_xid` (BE-load to host-order int → matches host-order local). Symmetric. **No discipline mismatch**; no fix required.
- **Item 6 (Fix D — options walker)**: `dhcp_find_option` (net.cyr:238-251) correctly handles tag 0 (Pad → skip 1 byte no length), tag 255 (End → return -1), bounds-checks `i + 1 >= opts_len` before length read AND `i + 2 + olen > opts_len` before advance. Walker invariants intact. **No fix required.**

Both confirmed via single-pass code read; documented in audit doc § 10 for future audit traceability.

#### Item 1 — `tcpdump` wire capture (user-side, zero AGNOS code)

Documented in [agnosticos `iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § 1.32.4 next-burn prep](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md). User invocation from Linux side during next AGNOS burn:

```sh
sudo tcpdump -i enp1s0 -nn -X -s 0 'port 67 or port 68' -w /tmp/dhcp-capture.pcap
# Reboot to AGNOS USB; let DHCP DISCOVER + OFFER-wait window run
# Power-cycle to Linux; ctrl-C tcpdump; replay with -r flag
```

Outcome decoding: OFFER on wire + AGNOS still times out = (c2) confirmed (downstream-of-r8169_poll bug); only DISCOVER + no OFFER = (c1) confirmed (server didn't reply, or replied unicast to different MAC) — different fix path.

### Build trajectory

| Cut | x86_64 (production) | x86_64 (TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1) | Delta | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.32.3 close | 617,000 B | 617,984 B | — | BSD/iPXE r8169 rewrite + Attempt 100 PARTIAL baseline |
| **1.32.4 close** | **621,816 B** | — (production ships) | **+4,816 B vs 1.32.3** | 10-bundle matcher hardening + outbound L3 routing (`route_next_hop_mac` + persistent gateway-MAC slot) + ARP byte-order fix + boot-time STATIC-IP/ARP/TCP test. LAA override added then removed same-cycle (net-zero on the MAC). AF_PACKET probe harness lives in agnosticos (not counted here). |

cyrius pin stays on 6.0.1. gnoboot stays on 0.4.2. **MVP gate (boot-to-shell with typeable keyboard on iron) green** since Attempt 68 / 1.30.9 — every 1.32.x burn has reached `AGNOS shell vX.Y.Z` byte-clean; no regression expected from this cycle since changes are scoped to `dhcp_init` validation + diagnostics-only stamps.

### Cycle arc — pivot to ARP probe, then zero-burn isolation (Attempts 101–102, 2026-05-24)

The 10-bundle above (cycle-open) hardened the DHCP OFFER/ACK matcher, but the cycle never reached the DHCP path on iron — a more fundamental L2 gate surfaced first, and the cycle pivoted to chase it.

#### Added — outbound L3 routing helper (`kernel/core/net.cyr`)

- `route_next_hop_mac(dst_ip, out_mac)` — on-LAN destinations resolve directly; off-LAN destinations resolve via the cached gateway MAC. Replaces a hardcoded broadcast MAC in `udp_send` + `tcp_send_pkt` that prevented off-LAN unicast (e.g., 1.1.1.1) from routing through the gateway. Convergent shape across Linux / lwIP / iPXE / *BSD / U-Boot / Plan 9 per [`agnosticos/.../dhcp-and-outbound-l3-audit-2026-05-24.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/dhcp-and-outbound-l3-audit-2026-05-24.md).
- `net_gateway_mac[8]` persistent slot + `net_gateway_mac_valid` — populated by the boot-time ARP-to-gateway probe, independent of `arp_cache_*` so later ARP traffic doesn't clobber it.

#### Added — boot-time STATIC-IP + ARP-probe + outbound-TCP test (`kernel/core/main.cyr`)

DHCP-bypass diagnostic: install static `192.168.1.222` → ARP the gateway → on reply, cache the gateway MAC and `tcp_connect(1.1.1.1, 80)` to exercise L3 + off-LAN routing + RX-of-unicast-reply + the TCP three-way handshake in one shot.

#### Fixed — ARP request field byte-order (`kernel/core/net.cyr` `arp_request`)

htype / ptype / oper written as explicit big-endian byte pairs instead of `store16` (host-order on x86). Attempt 101's egress carried byte-swapped `htype=0x0100 / ptype=0x0008 / oper=0x0100` and the switch dropped it as malformed. Mirror of the same fix already present in `net_handle_arp`.

#### Added then Removed — sovereign-MAC (LAA) override (`kernel/core/r8169.cyr`)

A U/L-bit flip (`b0→b2`) was added to dodge a hypothesized router IP-source-guard/DAI drop, then **removed the same cycle** when `arp-probe-raw` falsified the theory (the gateway replied to the real `b0` MAC claiming `.222` while Linux held a live `b0` lease). Net MAC behavior is unchanged from 1.32.3 (EEPROM-autoloaded `b0`); the override only added unicast-filter risk.

#### Added — Cyrius AF_PACKET probe harness (`agnosticos/scripts/dhcp-probe/`)

`arp-probe-raw` (NEW) + `dhcp-probe-raw` build AGNOS's frames **verbatim** (construction functions copied from `net.cyr`) and send them on the real wire via AF_PACKET. Zero-burn isolation tool: `dhcp-probe-raw` leased `.129`; `arp-probe-raw` drew `gateway 192.168.1.1 is at d4:6a:91:ce:70:60`. **Proves AGNOS's eth/IP/UDP/DHCP/ARP construction is wire-correct and the gateway replies to us.**

#### Falsified (branches retired)

- **IP-source-guard / DAI theory** — the LAA override's motivation; falsified by `arp-probe-raw` (b0/.222 drew a reply with Linux's b0 lease active).
- **Frame-construction + chip-init audit lineage** — every thread in [`r8169-chip-init-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/r8169-chip-init-audit.md) (RXDV-gate, Cfg9346/32-bit-MAC, MAR, RxConfig-profile, MCU-body) is closed by the Linux proof. A fresh datasheet-level re-derivation of the RX filter / ring / poll found no structural fault.

### Iron evidence

- **Attempt 101** (2026-05-23) PARTIAL FALSIFIED — STATIC-IP + ARP probe; ARP-to-gateway timed out → bug is below DHCP (L1/L2/L3).
- **Attempt 102** (2026-05-24) FALSIFIED — LAA build + ARP byte-order fix + outbound routing; ARP still timed out. Boot-to-shell byte-clean; **drive-swap topology-independence validated** (AGNOS boot drive → internal NVMe slot, Linux → SATA WD Blue) with zero hardcoded-drive assumptions.
- **Attempt 103** (2026-05-24 ~17:24 PDT) FALSIFIED — EEPROM `b0` MAC build (LAA removed, 621,816 B, HEAD `18a6fc4`); ARP STILL timed out (`net: STATIC .222` → `arp: TIMEOUT` → `net: L1/L2 FAILED`, shell v1.32.4 reached byte-clean). Exactly the pre-burn rubric's falsification branch: with `b0` matching the `arp-probe-raw` the gateway answered on Linux, the **filter MAC is EXONERATED** → bug is purely r8169 RX delivery on iron. Photo `attempt-103-agnos-1.32.4-eeprom-b0-mac-arp-timeout-rx-isolated.jpg`.

### Outcome

Bug survives, but the cycle's gain is structural: the iron failure is now **isolated to r8169 RX delivery** (the reply reaches the PHY but not `r8169_poll`), with construction + TX + gateway-replies-to-us all proven on Linux and the entire chip-init audit surface closed. **Attempt 103 (EEPROM `b0`, 621,816 B) confirmed the falsification branch on iron**: ARP still timed out with the EEPROM MAC, so the filter MAC is exonerated and the next move is MMIO / descriptor-DMA observability on the RX ring — not another construction/chip-init audit. The clean TX-vs-RX disambiguator is a second-machine `tcpdump -nn -e arp` on a mirrored switch port during a burn (archaemenid can't sniff its own boot).

## [1.32.3] — 2026-05-23 (virtio-net modern rewrite — QEMU DHCP full cycle works; r8169 RX-path audit landed + 3-part fix for iron-side OFFER-timeout; Iron Attempt 96 falsified the 1.32.2 4-FIX bundle, CMOS evidence proves r8169 chip engines healthy)

### Context — two independent bugs, same shell symptom

Iron Attempt 96 (2026-05-23, photos `iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-96-agnos-1.32.2-r8169-link-up-rx-tx-rings-up.jpg` + `attempt-96-agnos-1.32.2-fix-7-8-9-10-offer-timeout-persists.jpg`) was burned with the full 1.32.2 4-FIX bundle (#7 IDR write-back + #8 UDP buffer 1024B + #9 DISCOVER/REQUEST midpoint retransmit + #10 PHY-restart-only-if-down). Result: `dhcp: DISCOVER → dhcp: OFFER timeout` — same symptom as Attempts 93/94/95. The r8169 boot block printed BOTH `PHY autoneg kicked (link async)` AND `link up` BEFORE RX/TX init ran, so FIX #10's safe-path branch fired and the engine-wedge mechanism the bundle was designed to prevent did not apply.

Same-session CMOS verbose readback (`sudo ./scripts/read-boot-log.sh --verbose`) decoded the post-mortem unambiguously: 0x58=0x01 (probe done), 0x59=0x01 (PHY LINK UP — autoneg completed), 0x5A=0x02 (TX sends fired twice — DISCOVER + FIX #9 retransmit), **0x5B=0x30 (TX OWN cleared — NIC processed the descriptor and egressed the frame)**, 0x5C=0xFF (RX poll saturated), 0x5D=0x80 (RX desc re-armed), **0x5E=0x01 (RX DMA visible — NIC captured a multicast frame)**. Byte-identical to Attempt 94's healthy baseline. **The r8169 NIC engines are not the bottleneck.** Attempt 94's original framing ("OFFER-timeout root cause moves UPSTREAM of NIC") was correct all along; the 1.32.1 + 1.32.2 audits chased the FIX #3 engine-wedge regression and missed that fixing it (correctly) just restored the original Attempt-94 evidence baseline.

Per user direction "exhaust the QEMU route before more burns and we can do the CMOS items then", the next investigation moved to QEMU + virtio-net + SLIRP + `-object filter-dump` pcap. **The 1.32.0 cycle's "SLIRP-RX gap" framing was wrong** — pcap captures the wire directly and showed AGNOS-egress frames were missing entirely (only OVMF's IPv6 NS DAD probe in 126-byte pcap). SLIRP RX is fine; the AGNOS legacy virtio_net driver was the broken component, not SLIRP. Iron and QEMU were two independent bugs with the same shell-level symptom.

### Added — `agnosticos/docs/development/virtio-net-legacy-layout-audit.md` (multi-source convergent)

Audit doc (~315 lines) landed in agnosticos. Per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]]: triangulates OASIS virtio 1.0 / 1.1 spec § 2.4.2 + Linux `include/uapi/linux/virtio_ring.h` (`vring_init`, `vring_size`) + Linux `drivers/virtio/virtio_pci_legacy.c` + OpenBSD `sys/dev/pv/virtio.c` (`virtio_alloc_vq`) + FreeBSD `sys/dev/virtio/virtqueue.c` + FreeBSD `sys/dev/virtio/pci/virtio_pci_legacy.c`. Three independent prior-art sources converge on the same formula: each virtqueue is **one physically-contiguous block** laid out as `desc | avail | pad-to-Queue-Align(4096) | used`, with the device computing `avail_base = desc_base + 16*qsz` and `used_base = ALIGN_UP(avail_base + 6 + 2*qsz, 4096)`. Only the desc-base PFN crosses the doorbell — there is no transport-side mechanism to communicate three independent base addresses, so a split-array layout is structurally undetectable to the device. Audit captures verdict (CONFIRMED), spec quotation, Linux/BSD code citations with line numbers, AGNOS divergence walk through `virtio_net.cyr:6-13` + `:39-47` + `:80-105`, minimum-viable fix shape (Approach A: over-allocate + offset), LOC estimate, secondary findings (RX descriptor-slot-rotation, MRG_RXBUF feature-mask trap), risk + cross-references. Post-implementation update appended after the legacy rewrite hit a third bug.

### Added — `kernel/core/virtio_net.cyr` modern rewrite (148 LOC legacy → 366 LOC modern; replaces the v1.30.x-era 0.9.5 driver)

Full rewrite to OASIS VirtIO 1.2 modern PCI transport per § 4.1 + § 5.1, mirroring `virtio_blk.cyr`'s proven shape. Accepts both pure-modern (device ID `0x1041`) and transitional (`0x1000`) — cap-list presence is the gate, not the device ID. Multi-source convergent per `virtio-net-legacy-layout-audit.md` § "Post-implementation update": OpenBSD `vio.c` for net-specific queue ordering (queue 0 = RX, queue 1 = TX per § 5.1.2), Linux `drivers/net/virtio_net.c` for header handling, FreeBSD `if_vtnet.c` for cap-walk classification.

Shape highlights:
- **PCI capability-list walk** (`vnet_scan_caps`) finds COMMON_CFG / NOTIFY_BASE / ISR_CFG / DEVICE_CFG MMIO bases. Validates BAR index < 6 + offset+length wrap-around (per Linux's `virtio_pci_modern_dev.c:57-62` security check), UC-remaps each BAR via `vmm_remap_uc_2mb`. Identical structure to `vblk_scan_caps`.
- **8-step init** (`virtio_net_init`): reset → ACK → DRIVER → feature negotiation with FEATURES_OK gate → per-queue setup → DRIVER_OK. Features accepted: `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` (mandatory) + `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC` (opportunistic). All others (MRG_RXBUF, CTRL_VQ, CSUM, GSO, MQ, ANY_LAYOUT, EVENT_IDX, INDIRECT_DESC, …) deliberately unack'd — keeps the 12-byte modern header valid per § 5.1.6.1 and avoids extra queues that would need separate plumbing.
- **Per-queue setup helper** (`vnet_setup_queue`) — three `pmm_alloc` calls per queue (desc + avail + used), `vmm_map` identity-maps each, zero-fills, writes 64-bit phys to QUEUE_DESC_LO/HI / QUEUE_DRIVER_LO/HI / QUEUE_DEVICE_LO/HI, computes notify address from `QUEUE_NOTIFY × notify_off_multiplier`, sets QUEUE_ENABLE=1. Called twice — queue 0 (RX) and queue 1 (TX).
- **RX bootstrap** (`vnet_rx_prime`) — pre-arms all 16 RX descriptors with 1536-byte slots from `vnet_rx_buf` (24 KB total = 16 × 1536). Publishes all 16 to the avail ring, sets avail.idx=16, doorbells RX queue. Each subsequent `virtio_net_poll` rotates one slot back into the ring after consumption.
- **TX path** (`virtio_net_send`) — single 12-byte modern virtio-net header zero-filled + num_buffers field = 1, frame copied into `vnet_tx_buf` (1536 B), one descriptor published at slot `tx_idx % qsize`, wmb (mfence `0F AE F0`) between slot write and avail.idx increment per § 2.7.13.3.1, doorbell at TX queue.
- **RX path** (`virtio_net_poll`) — reads used.idx, rmb (mfence) per § 2.7.13.4.1, decodes used-ring entry (desc_id + pkt_len), copies frame past 12-byte hdr into caller buffer, re-arms descriptor, republishes on avail ring with wmb, doorbells RX queue. Returns data_len or 0 if no frame ready.
- **MAC accessor** (`virtio_net_mac`) — reads from `vnet_device_cfg + 0..5` (DEVICE_CFG offset 0 = 6-byte MAC, valid post-FEATURES_OK).

Polled-only — no MSI-X plumbing. Same posture as virtio_blk: no ISR byte read, watch used.idx directly via net_poll callers. MSI-X vector registers (`VNET_CFG_MSIX_VEC`, `VNET_QUEUE_MSIX_VEC`) left at default 0xFFFF (NO_VECTOR).

### Fixed — PCI bus-master enable (audit miss, surfaced during implementation)

The original legacy driver was missing `pci_enable_bus_master(PciDev_slot(...))` — a one-line call that's present in nvme/ahci/virtio_blk paths but absent here. Without bus-master enabled in the PCI command register, the device cannot DMA from descriptor pages: writes to BAR0 I/O ports work (so MAC reads + status writes succeeded), but descriptor reads from system RAM silently failed. The audit caught the layout violation but not this. Modern rewrite includes the bus-master enable as step 1 of `virtio_net_init`, matching the existing virtio_blk pattern.

### Fixed — Feature negotiation discipline

Pre-rewrite, the driver wrote back ALL device-offered features unfiltered. If QEMU advertised `VIRTIO_NET_F_MRG_RXBUF` (bit 15, default-on for virtio-net legacy), the virtio-net header would silently expand from 10 to 12 bytes — but the legacy driver's hardcoded `hdr_len=10` in send/poll would have been off-by-2, corrupting every frame. Modern rewrite accepts only `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` + `VIRTIO_NET_F_MAC` and explicitly drops everything else; FEATURES_OK readback verifies the device accepted the subset (per § 2.2.2 — driver MUST NOT retry on rejection, full reset is the only recovery).

### Validated — QEMU full DHCP cycle

QEMU smoke (`scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh` with virtio-net-pci + SLIRP):

```
Activating scheduler...
dhcp: DISCOVER
dhcp: OFFER ip=10.0.2.15
dhcp: REQUEST
dhcp: ACK ip=10.0.2.15 gw=10.0.2.2 mask=255.255.255.0
tcp_listen smoke: start
tcp_listen(8080) lid=0
tcp_accept: conn_id=1
tcp_listen smoke: done
```

Pcap evidence (`-object filter-dump,id=f0,netdev=u1,file=/tmp/agnos-dhcp.pcap` — 1915 B, 5 frames):

1. AGNOS → broadcast, UDP dst=67 (DHCP DISCOVER, 291 B)
2. SLIRP `10.0.2.2` → broadcast, UDP dst=68 (DHCP OFFER, 590 B)
3. AGNOS → broadcast, UDP dst=67 (DHCP REQUEST, 298 B)
4. SLIRP `10.0.2.2` → broadcast, UDP dst=68 (DHCP ACK, 590 B)
5. AGNOS ARP (42 B, gratuitous post-lease)

Compare to 1.32.2 pcap: 126 B total, only OVMF's IPv6 NS — zero AGNOS frames. The modern rewrite is the first time AGNOS networking actually works end-to-end in QEMU.

### Validated — no regression in storage subsystems

- `scripts/test.sh` — 4/4 PASS
- `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` — 5/5 PASS (1-baseline, 2-ahci-wholedisk, 3-nvme-partition, 4-combined-order, 5-64bit-partition) + 5/5 regression cross-check (every smoke reaches `AGNOS shell v`)
- Build trajectory: 604,096 B (1.32.1 close) → 605,056 B (1.32.2 4-FIX) → **616,744 B (1.32.3 production, post-modern-rewrite)**. Net +11,688 B vs 1.32.2 / +12,648 B vs 1.32.1.

### Deferred — legacy virtio-net interface (1.34.x cleanup)

The legacy 0.9.5 interface still exists in the transitional virtio-net-pci device (BAR0 I/O ports, contiguous in-page queue layout, `QUEUE_PFN` register). Per user direction 2026-05-23: switch to modern now, revisit legacy in 1.34.x. Modern works on every QEMU virtio-net-pci variant (default transitional + non-transitional) and is the path forward; the legacy code path is removed from `virtio_net.cyr` but the audit doc preserves the broken-layout analysis for future reference. If a true legacy-only device (no modern caps in the cap list) appears in some target hardware, `vnet_scan_caps` returns -1 and `virtio_net_init` fails gracefully — `nic_ready()` will report no NIC and the kernel boots to shell without networking, identical to the no-NIC iron path. Carry-forward into 1.34.x: stand up a separate legacy-mode init path that consumes the BAR0 I/O ports + `QUEUE_PFN` interface, gated behind a runtime-detect (cap-list absent → fall back to legacy). The legacy investigation surfaced a third bug beyond the layout violation — doorbell reaches the device + status=DRIVER_OK + spec-correct contiguous layout + bus-master on, but `virtio_net_handle_tx` never fires in QEMU's trace. Three candidate diagnoses recorded in `virtio-net-legacy-layout-audit.md` § "Post-implementation update": memory-ordering between `store16` and `outw`, I/O port sequence diff vs working virtio_blk, or QEMU-side handling of OVMF-prior-init transitional state. Park until 1.34.x.

### Added — agnosticos planning + doc work this cycle

- **`docs/development/planning/usb-hardening.md`** — beta-phase USB defensive stack (~200 lines). Threat model (BadUSB / Stuxnet / Cottonmouth / Thunderclap / syzkaller-Linux-USB-RCE), five defensive stages (pre-descriptor validation → class-policy → in-kernel per-device auth via aegis → behavioral sandboxing via kavach/phylax → IOMMU DMA isolation via AMD-Vi/Intel VT-d). Repo touch-points table, phased ordering (1 + 5 first, then 2 → 3 → 4), libro audit-chain integration mandatory. Public-beta scope, NOT MVP.
- **`docs/development/first-party/`** — new subdirectory split out of `docs/development/planning/`. Moved `first-party-standards.md`, `first-party-documentation.md`, `example_claude.md`. Updated 11 live-doc cross-references across 10 files; archive + CHANGELOG historical entries intentionally preserved at the old path. Planning README index pointer added. New folder is the canonical home for future standards / template docs (e.g., `doc-health.example.md`).
- **`docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 96** — full receipt with transcribed boot output (r8169 init block + post-scheduler block), CMOS readback decode (0x58-0x5F), branch (a) confirmation, three-way next-move framing (a1 external DHCP validation / a2-code-audit RX-path stack walk / a2-stamp one-CMOS-stamp burn). User picked (a1) external — pending. QEMU pivot folded into Attempt 96 narrative same-day.
- **`docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` tracker for 1.32.2** — updated from "OPEN — sweep hardening" → "Attempt 96 FALSIFIED 4-FIX bundle; CMOS readback completed → Branch (a) confirmed: NIC engines healthy, root cause upstream/downstream of NIC".
- **`scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`** — argparse `else` clause added so typo'd args (`--versbose`) error out instead of silently falling through to the default focused-summary; preamble refreshed from stale "Attempt 77 prep — agnos 1.30.12 — VGA font swap" to current "agnos 1.32.2 — FIX #7+#8+#9+#10 + Attempt 96 result". Per [[feedback_script_preambles_are_forward_looking]] — this had drifted across the 1.30.12 → 1.32.x arc.
- **Photos catalogued** — both Attempt 96 photos moved from agnosticos top-level into `docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/` with the existing `attempt-N-agnos-X.Y.Z-<symptom>.jpg` naming convention.
- **New memory** — `feedback_top_level_photos_are_fresh_iron.md` — if the user drops `1322_*.jpg` at the agnosticos top level, those are FRESH iron-burn evidence (Attempt N+1, look up max from iron-nuc-zen-log and increment), not historical context. Cross-references `feedback_read_state_at_session_start`.

### Added — `agnosticos/docs/development/r8169-rx-path-audit.md` (multi-source convergent, 524 lines)

Per-line audit of `r8169_init_rx` + `r8169_poll` against Linux `r8169_main.c` v6.6 (`rtl_rx` lines 4417-4501, `rtl8169_mark_to_asic` lines 3799-3807), OpenBSD `re_rxeof` (`sys/dev/ic/re.c` lines 1576-1710), FreeBSD `re_rxeof` (`sys/dev/re/if_re.c` lines 3451-3651), plus RTL8168 datasheet § 6.7 + § 13.2. Triangulated divergence catalogue with severity ranks (LOAD-BEARING / LIKELY CONTRIBUTORS / COSMETIC), per-divergence quote pointing at the AGNOS line + each reference's line. Verdict: **LOAD-BEARING bug is `r8169_poll` returning after a single descriptor** (lines 530-532 + 550-551). On a live LAN, IPv4 multicast (`01:00:5e:...`) re-fills descriptor 0 between every poll call; the OFFER landing at a later slot is never inspected because the function returns before walking past the multicast slot. CMOS slot 0x5E=0x01 at Attempt 96 was the multicast first byte, NOT the OFFER's `0xb0` unicast or `0xff` broadcast — the dispositive evidence that the chip is healthy and frames DO land in the ring; we just never look at the right slot.

LIKELY CONTRIBUTORS surfaced: missing `RES` (Receive Error Summary, bit 21) check + missing `FS|LS` complete-frame gate. Pre-fix, errored / fragmented frames had garbage `pkt_len` passed up to `ethernet_recv` which parsed junk ethertypes and silently dropped them — burning iterations of `dhcp_init`'s 800-iter OFFER-wait loop on background bad frames. Secondary findings: CMOS-stamp performance tax (~8 µs per poll, three stamps × ~2 µs each via 0x70/0x71 port-IO) competes with frame arrival rate; RxMaxSize over-tight at 1523 vs Linux's effective-disable at 16384; RxConfig high bits cosmetic divergence (0xE700 vs Linux modern 0xCF00).

### Added — `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` RX-path fix (3 parts, ~40 LOC net)

**Part A — multi-frame budget loop in `r8169_poll`** (LOAD-BEARING). Mirrors Linux `rtl_rx` line 4417 / OpenBSD line 1576 / FreeBSD line 3451 — all three walk the ring via budget-driven loops, skip bad slots, return on first good frame. New shape:

```
while (budget-- > 0) {
    load opts1; if (OWN) return 0;            # NIC still owns from here on — stop
    if (RES) { rearm; advance; continue; }    # error: skip
    if ((opts1 & FRAG_MASK) != FRAG_MASK)     # fragmented: skip
        { rearm; advance; continue; }
    extract len, copy frame, rearm, advance, return len;
}
```

Budget = 16 (one full ring walk). The OFFER gets delivered on the first poll cycle that overlaps with its arrival — not "after `dhcp_init` exhausts 800 iterations chewing through multicast one-frame-per-call."

**Part B — `RES` + `FS|LS` gating constants** (LIKELY CONTRIBUTORS). New module-level constants:

```
var R8169_DESC_RES   = 0x00200000;  # Receive Error Summary (RxRES — Linux line 361)
var R8169_FRAG_MASK  = 0x30000000;  # FS | LS — frame complete when both set
```

Used inside Part A's body before length extraction. Pre-fix, an RES frame's reported length could be 0 / 2048 / garbage; `ethernet_recv` would parse a garbage ethertype and drop silently — the slot still consumed a poll iteration.

**Part C — `r8169_rx_rearm(desc)` helper with EOR read-preserve** (COSMETIC, but cheap). Mirrors Linux `rtl8169_mark_to_asic` lines 3799-3807. Reads back the current EOR bit from `opts1` instead of hard-coding "EOR on idx==15." Pre-fix and post-fix agree today (16-slot ring with EOR at the last slot), but a future ring-resize would silently lose EOR. Replaces the inline 4-line rearm in two sites (success path + skip path).

**Part D — CMOS-stamp hot-path elimination** (audit S-1). Pre-fix `r8169_poll` performed 4 CMOS stamps on every call (RX_POLL_COUNT + RX_DESC0_OWN + RX_DESC0_BYTE0 + TX_DESC0_OWN) at ~2 µs each via 0x70/0x71 port-IO = ~8 µs hot-path tax. With Part A's multi-frame loop running up to 16 times per poll entry, the per-poll cost could easily compete with frame arrival rate on a live LAN — exactly the kind of throughput cliff that lets a single OFFER frame slip through the cracks while we burn CPU stamping CMOS. Stamps now fire only on state transitions: RX_POLL_COUNT + RX_DESC0_OWN + RX_DESC0_BYTE0 stamp only inside the successful-frame-consume branch (so they refresh whenever we actually deliver a frame upstream); TX_DESC0_OWN moved into `r8169_send` and fires when `tx_idx == 1` (the natural "first send completed, next slot active" transition). Post-burn CMOS readback for `read-boot-log.sh --verbose` reflects the same diagnostic story but the hot-path tax is gone.

**Part E — `RxMaxSize` aligned with Linux convergent** (audit S-2). `r8169_init_rx` step 5 now writes `0x4000` (16384) instead of `0x05F3` (1523), matching the Linux v6.6 `rtl_init_one` "effective-disable" pattern. Pre-fix value excluded any VLAN-tagged frame >1518 — not a factor for DHCP-on-untagged-LAN but a convergence gap the audit flagged. Two-byte register write change, no behavior delta expected on the iron test surface.

### Validated — no regression on storage + networking

- `scripts/test.sh` — 4/4 PASS
- `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` — 5/5 PASS + 5/5 regression
- `scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh` — QEMU modern virtio_net DHCP cycle (DISCOVER → OFFER 10.0.2.15 → REQUEST → ACK → tcp_accept conn_id=1) confirmed still working post-r8169-fix
- Build: 616,744 B (1.32.3 baseline, pre-r8169-fix) → 617,128 B (Parts A+B+C only) → **617,000 B (Parts A+B+C+D+E, current)**. Net **+256 B** for the full 5-part RX-path bundle (Part D's hot-path-stamp removal actually shrinks the binary by 128 B relative to A+B+C). cyrius 6.0.1 + gnoboot 0.4.2 unchanged.

**Iron-burn validation pending user direction** per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]. Expected outcome on archaemenid (assuming the audit's load-bearing diagnosis holds): full DHCP cycle `dhcp: DISCOVER → OFFER ip=192.168.1.X → REQUEST → ACK gw=192.168.1.1 mask=255.255.255.0`, leasing from the same `192.168.1.1` gateway that Linux uses on the same wire.

### Added — agnosticos network ground-truth check 2026-05-23 (decisive evidence for r8169 RX-path framing)

Pulled `ip -br link` + `ip -br addr` + `ip route` on archaemenid's current Linux session (same machine that runs AGNOS via USB stick). Result:

```
enp1s0   UP   b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25   192.168.1.124/24   default via 192.168.1.1 proto dhcp
```

That's the r8169 chip — same MAC AGNOS sees, same port, same cable — actively leased by Linux dhclient from 192.168.1.1 under the running OS. **Branch (a1) wire/server hypothesis FALSIFIED.** The DHCP server is reachable, responsive, and willing to serve this NIC's MAC. The iron OFFER timeout MUST be a code bug in AGNOS's RX path — branch (a2-r8169-RX). This evidence drove the audit + fix above; pre-evidence I had been speculating about external validation paths that didn't apply on a single-machine dev setup (the agnosticos `feedback_top_level_photos_are_fresh_iron` + `project_hardware_catalog` memories both updated with the "no Linux laptop" correction).

### Out-of-cycle carry-forward (continues)

- **i225-V driver** — Intel 2.5GbE driver, pending Intel-NIC iron (post-archaemenid-migration). ~700-1100 LOC. Mirrors r8169 Phase 1-4 shape.
- **BBS + MUD userland** — separate standalone repos. Arrive when wire-end-to-end TCP accept-success works on iron. Move in parallel.
- **Iron Attempt 97 — validates 1.32.3 r8169 RX-path 5-part bundle** (Parts A+B+C+D+E) on archaemenid. Target outcome: `dhcp: OFFER ip=192.168.1.X / REQUEST / ACK gw=192.168.1.1 mask=255.255.255.0` lines on the boot console. If still `OFFER timeout` after the full bundle: re-audit at a finer grain (single-source Linux-only vs the prior multi-source convergent shape may have missed a chip-rev-specific quirk, e.g. CPlusCmd register at MMIO 0xE0 which AGNOS doesn't touch). Pending user-authorized iron burn per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]].
- **Legacy virtio-net interface** — full 1.34.x bite per "Deferred" section above.

### Build trajectory across 1.32.x

| Cycle | Build size (production) | Net delta | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1.32.0 close | 601,392 B | — | Networking arc feature-complete (TCP server + UDP server + DHCP client + r8169 Phases 1-4) |
| 1.32.1 close | 604,096 B | +2,704 B | 6-FIX bundle (nic_mac + net_init iron path + non-blocking PHY + chaddr + 800-iter timeout + RxConfig constants) |
| 1.32.2 close | 605,056 B | +960 B | 4-FIX bundle (IDR write-back + UDP buf 1024 + DHCP retransmit + PHY-restart-only-if-down) |
| **1.32.3 close** | **617,000 B** | **+11,944 B** | **virtio-net legacy → modern rewrite + r8169 RX-path 5-part bundle (multi-frame loop + RES/FS\|LS gating + rx_rearm helper + CMOS-stamp hot-path elimination + RxMaxSize Linux-converge); QEMU DHCP works end-to-end; iron Attempt 97 pending** |

cyrius pin stays on 6.0.1. gnoboot stays on 0.4.2. MVP gate (boot-to-shell with typeable keyboard on iron) green since Attempt 68 / 1.30.9 and confirmed still green at Attempt 96.

### Iron-side outcomes (Attempts 97 / 98 / 99 / 100 — 2026-05-23 evening, tag-cut catch-up)

Four iron burns landed against 1.32.3 across the day. The r8169 chip-level RX filter is the through-line: every burn until the last left the chip stuck on multicast-only consumption (`[0x5E]=0x01`); the final BSD/iPXE-shape rewrite is the first iron evidence that a broadcast frame can be admitted at all.

- **Attempt 97** (commit `a065f45 "another repair bundle for rx"`, ~14:30 PDT) — 5-part RX-path bundle (Part A multi-frame budget loop + Part B `RES`/`FS|LS` gating + Part C `r8169_rx_rearm` w/ EOR read-preserve + Part D state-transition CMOS stamps + Part E `RxMaxSize` 0x05F3 → 0x4000) burned per the audit doc. **PARTIAL**: mechanics validated end-to-end on iron (`[0x5C]=0x10` 16 frames consumed, `[0x5D]=0x78` EOR+FS+LS+MAR, Part B/C/D fingerprint matches the design), but `dhcp: OFFER timeout` persisted — all 16 consumed frames were multicast, no broadcast/unicast OFFER among them. Root cause moves **upstream** of `r8169_poll`. Two photo parts catalogued: `attempt-97-…-pt1-r8169-link-up-preserved-bios-rings-up-storage-clean.jpg` + `attempt-97-…-pt2-rx-multi-frame-loop-16-frames-offer-timeout-persists.jpg`.
- **Attempt 98** (commit `1e9d26a "burn ready"`, 15:56 PDT) — high-confidence Linux mac_version-46 convergent fix: single-constant `R8169_RXCFG_DEFAULTS = 0xE700 → 0xCF00` (Linux v7.0 `rtl_init_rxcfg` VER_40..52 profile, sets `RX_EARLY_OFF` bit 11). **FALSIFIED**: production build, `dhcp: OFFER timeout` persisted in FB; Early-RX-OFF landing did not admit broadcast. Photo: `attempt-98-agnos-1.32.3-rxcfg-cf00-offer-timeout-persists.jpg`.
- **Attempt 99** (commit `ab913aa "more rx fixes"`, 16:28 PDT) — additional Linux-shape rx fixes layered on Attempt 98's RxConfig change. **FALSIFIED** — CMOS byte-identical to Attempts 97/98 (chip admits multicast, drops broadcast + unicast). No top-level photo captured. A subsequent post-Attempt-99 Linux MCU body bundle was built but never burned then deleted at user direction (*"STOP REFERRING TO LINUX… THERE IS OTHER ARTS… PLAN THAT SHIT APPROPRIATELY… FIX THE WHOLE THING, NOT JUST MICRO FIX"*), retiring the Linux-clone audit lineage entirely.
- **Attempt 100** (commits `547a6b0 "bundled work for gated"` → `976fea8 "formate"` → `4d0384f "rewrite"`, build mtime 19:17 PDT, photo at 20:10 PDT) — **BSD/iPXE-shape r8169 rewrite** under multi-source convergent (iPXE `realtek.c` + FreeBSD `if_re.c` 8168G_PLUS branch + OpenBSD/NetBSD `re.c`/`rtl8169.c` + RTL8111B/8168B datasheet + Linux 6.6.2 RTL8168H erratum patch). **−343 LOC net** (deleted `r8169_hw_start_8168h_1` 250-LOC Linux MCU body + Cfg9346 unlock/lock envelope + `mac_ocp_*` / `ephy_*` / `eri_*` helpers + 32-bit MAC writeback). Rewrote `r8169_probe` post-reset to iPXE 14-LOC shape (CPlusCmd PCIMulRW + RXDV gate clear + MAR all-1s, no Cfg9346 wrap); rewrote `r8169_init_tx` tail to single store32 BEFORE `CR=TE|RE` (NetBSD `RTKQ_TXRXEN_LATER` for `RTK_HWREV_8168H`); `R8169_RXCFG_DEFAULTS = 0xCF00 → 0xEF00` (BSD 8168G_PLUS with EARLYOFFV2). Build = 617,984 B `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1` variant. **PARTIAL — and the cycle-defining win**: `[0x5E]=0xff` ≡ prep PASS target, `[0x5D]=0x72` = EOR+FS+LS+BAR (BAR bit confirms broadcast desc), `[0x5A]=0x03` ≥ prep PASS target. **First iron evidence across the 1.32.x DHCP arc that a broadcast frame can be admitted by the chip at all.** `dhcp: OFFER timeout` still in FB → the gate now lives strictly DOWNSTREAM of `r8169_poll` (in DHCP matcher / `udp_recv_from` routing / xid filter, OR the admitted broadcast was not the DHCP OFFER but ARP/NetBIOS/mDNS). Photo: `attempt-100-agnos-1.32.3-bsd-ipxe-rewrite-broadcast-admitted-offer-still-times-out.jpg` + CMOS readback at `attempt-100-cmos-readback.txt`. Boot-tail now also includes `tcp_listen smoke: start / tcp_listen(8080) lid=0 / tcp_listen smoke: no connection within timeout / tcp_listen smoke: done` block (TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1 variant) — TCP listen plumbing wires correctly to the boot path on real ethernet driver state, not just QEMU.

**Cycle posture at tag**: PARTIAL forward progress. Chip-level RX filter unblocked is a material foothold — the 1.32.x DHCP arc has been gated on broadcast admission since Attempt 92, and Attempt 100 is the first iron evidence that hypothesis was the right shape. The residual DHCP-OFFER timeout (whether the admitted frame IS the OFFER vs whether OFFER admitted but lost downstream) carries forward to the next-round fix cycle. No iron burn auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — zero-burn disambiguation via `tcpdump -i enp1s0 'port 67 or port 68'` from the Linux side + `dhcp_init` / `udp_recv_from` / xid-matcher code audit lands first.

## [1.32.2] — 2026-05-23 (Networking arc continued — Attempt 95 falsified 1.32.1 fix-set on iron; full sweep-hardening cycle, FOUR more bugs found incl. FIX #3 regression cause)

### Context — what Attempt 95 actually showed

Iron Attempt 95 (2026-05-22 23:42, photo `iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-95-agnos-1.32.1-post-fix-phy-up-tx-rx-still-wedged.jpg`) was burned post-1.32.1-tag with the full 6-FIX bundle in place. Result: **`dhcp: DISCOVER` → `dhcp: OFFER timeout`** — identical symptom to Attempts 93 + 94. Storage trio + GPT + ext4 mount + kybernet + shell byte-clean (no regression from Attempts 90-94). Photo crop catches post-scheduler-activation prose only (r8169 init block + CMOS readback not in frame); diagnosing from code + prior-art convergence per [[feedback_known_knowledge_first]] + [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]].

The 1.32.1 close-shape note in state.md flagged Attempt 95 as "deferred" — that was wrong. The previous agent didn't log the burn that actually happened. 1.32.2 corrects the gap (iron-nuc-zen-log § Attempt 95) and lands the three additional bugs the iron evidence + a second-pass sweep surfaced.

### Added — Sweep-hardening DHCP fixes (FIXes 7-9 per dhcp-end-to-end-audit.md)

**FIX #7 — IDR0..IDR5 reprogrammed after reset** (~6 LOC in `r8169.cyr`, the most likely root cause of Attempt 95's OFFER timeout). The 1.32.1 FIX #6 audit pass added named constants to RxConfig but missed the load-bearing concern raised at audit FINDING #6: "If `RxConfig.APM` is set before `IDR0..IDR5` is written, no unicast match will succeed." Reset (`r8169.cyr:345` CR.RST write) clears the NIC's hardware unicast MAC filter to zeros. `RxConfig.APM=1` tells the NIC to accept unicast frames *only* when the dst MAC matches `IDR0..IDR5` — which is now zero. Any unicast DHCP OFFER reply (servers that ignore the BOOTP broadcast flag — Cisco WLCs, Mikrotik, some embedded servers) is rejected by the hardware filter before reaching the RX ring. Linux's `rtl_rar_set` writes MAC0 (0x00) + MAC4 (0x04) every bring-up after reset; OpenBSD's `re_setaddr` does the same; FreeBSD/NetBSD mirror OpenBSD. We didn't. New shape: after reset-poll succeeds in `r8169_probe`, a 6-byte loop writes the saved `r8169_mac` back to `R8169_REG_IDR0 + i` before PHY init.

**FIX #8 — UDP buffer + DHCP rx sized for full DHCP payloads** (~6 LOC across 4 sites in `net.cyr`). Pre-fix, `net_handle_udp` capped `udp_data_len` at 248 bytes (`net.cyr:491`) — but a typical DHCP OFFER/ACK is 300+ bytes of UDP payload (240-byte BOOTP fixed header + ~30-60 bytes of options). Server-id (option 54), subnet mask (option 1), gateway (option 3) live past byte 248; even if msg-type (option 53) is detected (it's usually first in the options blob), the REQUEST would carry wrong/zero `server_id` → server NAK or ignore → "dhcp: ACK timeout" downstream. Three coordinated changes: (a) `udp_bind` `kmalloc(256)` → `kmalloc(1024)` for the per-listener recv buffer; (b) `net_handle_udp` cap 248 → 1016 (`1024 - 8` UDP-header headroom); (c) `dhcp_init` local `var rx[320]` → `var rx[1024]` (function-local = byte units per [[feedback_cyrius_var_array_u64_units]]) with two `udp_recv_from(... 320 ...)` call-sites bumped to `1024`.

**FIX #9 — DHCP DISCOVER + REQUEST retransmission at midpoint** (~30 LOC in `net.cyr`). RFC 2131 §4.4.1 specifies clients retransmit DHCP on exponential backoff (4s → 8s → 16s → 32s, minimum 4 attempts). Pre-fix, we sent DISCOVER once and waited 8 seconds. If the first frame dropped (e.g., link still bringing up post-autoneg) OR the server's reply was lost, we timed out without a second try. New shape: each wait loop tracks an `iter % 400` rotation — at iteration 400 (~4 seconds into the 8-second window) we resend the same packet with the same `xid` (same DHCP session per RFC). Two retransmits total in the budget. Same xid means the server treats both as the same request and replies once; we just have two windows to catch the reply. Same shape for REQUEST. Full exponential backoff with random jitter deferred to a later refinement cycle; this is the minimum-viable RFC-compliance bump.

**FIX #10 — PHY autoneg restart only if link actually down** (~10 LOC net delta in `r8169.cyr`, the load-bearing fix that explains the Attempt 94 → 95 regression). Post-Attempt-95 evidence: CMOS `0x5B=0xb0` (TX OWN stuck) + `0x5E=0x00` (no RX DMA) — different from Attempt 94's `0x5B=0x30` (TX cleared) + `0x5E=0x01` (RX multicast captured). The only behavioral change between the two burns was 1.32.1 FIX #3 making `r8169_phy_init` non-blocking and **unconditionally writing `BMCR.ANRESTART`**. ANRESTART forces the PHY autoneg state machine back to start; link goes DOWN for 1-3 seconds while renegotiation runs. The kernel then races through `init_rx` → `init_tx` → scheduler activation within ~100ms of the BMCR write — all while link is down. Some RTL8168 variants wedge their TX/RX engines when CR.RE/CR.TE are set while link is down. Attempt 94's blocking version "worked" by accident: the busy-wait loop kept polling BMSR for ~8ms (race-condition delay), keeping init_rx from firing during autoneg-restart. New shape per multi-source convergent prior art (Linux `phy_start` async notifier; OpenBSD `re_init` media-change semantics; FreeBSD `re_init_locked` mirrors; NetBSD ditto): read BMSR.LinkStatus first (double-read for IEEE 802.3 §22.2.4.2 latching-low semantics); if link is already up (BIOS established it during cold-boot/PXE probe), log `r8169: PHY link up (preserved from BIOS)` and return — DO NOT TOUCH BMCR. Only kick `BMCR.ANRESTART` if link is genuinely down. Restart-on-every-probe is what every prior-art reference treats as a *state-change event* (resume, media change, link drop), not a probe-time default. FIX #3's default-on-restart was the bug.

**Validation**: `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS; `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 + 5/5 regression cross-check; `scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh` 1/2 (matches pre-fix 1.32.0 baseline — scenario 1 is pre-existing SLIRP-RX gap, iron-only). Build size 605,056 B production (vs 604,096 B at 1.32.1 close, +960 B for four fixes).

**Expected Attempt 96 outcome** (iron-burn pending user direction; not auto-proposed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]]): `r8169: found at … / MAC=… / chip-rev byte=… / reset OK / PHY autoneg kicked; (link async) / Phase 1 complete / RX ring up / TX ring up`, then `dhcp: DISCOVER / dhcp: OFFER ip=<lan-IP> / dhcp: REQUEST / dhcp: ACK ip=<lan-IP> gw=<gw> mask=<mask>`. CMOS 0x5E expected to read `0xFF` (broadcast OFFER) or `0xB0` (unicast OFFER to our MAC) — confirming the hardware filter now passes our MAC's unicast traffic.

## [1.32.1] — 2026-05-22 (Networking arc continued — Attempt 94 PARTIAL invalidated audit § 10 framing; 6-FIX DHCP wiring repair landed pre-Attempt-95)

### Added — DHCP end-to-end wiring repair (FIXes 1-6 per dhcp-end-to-end-audit.md)

User direction "fix all the issues" post-audit; all six findings from [`agnosticos/docs/development/dhcp-end-to-end-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/dhcp-end-to-end-audit.md) landed same-day in the existing 1.32.1 cycle (no version bump per [[feedback_no_unprompted_version_bumps]]; user-stated "this is all still in 1.32.1 cycle work, most likely close after burn either way"). Attempt 95 closes 1.32.1.

**FIX #1 — `nic_mac()` backend-agnostic kernel MAC accessor** (~80 LOC across `r8169.cyr` + `net.cyr`). The PRIMARY root cause of the Attempt 94 OFFER timeout. Pre-fix, every egress site in `net.cyr` (7 in total: arp_request × 2, udp_send, udp_send_from, dhcp_build_packet `chaddr`, ARP-reply × 2, tcp_send_pkt) read `&vnet_mac` directly. `vnet_mac` is defined in `virtio_net.cyr` and only populated by `virtio_net_init`. On iron with r8169 active and virtio absent, `vnet_mac` stayed all-zeros and the kernel sent every Ethernet frame with src MAC `00:00:00:00:00:00` AND every DHCP DISCOVER with BOOTP `chaddr` zeros. DHCP servers drop zero-chaddr requests per RFC 2131 §4.1 — explains why Attempt 94's bite-B CMOS readback showed TX descriptors clean (0x5B=0x30) + RX poll loop alive (0x5C=0xFF) + RX DMA captured a byte (0x5E=0x01 = background LLDP/multicast, not a DHCP OFFER). New `nic_mac(out_buf)` parallels `nic_ready`/`nic_send`/`nic_poll`: returns `r8169_mac` when r8169 is active, `vnet_mac` when virtio is active, zeros when no NIC backend is up. Every previous `&vnet_mac` net.cyr site now allocates a local `var kmac[8]` + `nic_mac(&kmac)`. Per [[feedback_prefer_generic_abstraction_at_call_sites]] — same shape as the 1.32.0 DHCP-gate-fix predicate (`vnet_active != 0 || nic_ready() != 0`).

**FIX #2 — `net_init()` on iron path** (~10 LOC in `main.cyr`). Pre-fix, `net_init(...)` was called only inside the `virtio_net_init() == 0` branch. On iron, that branch never runs (no virtio device) → `net_ip` / `net_gateway` / `net_netmask` stayed at module-default zero. New post-NIC-probe block calls `net_init(0, 0, 0)` gated on `nic_ready() == 1 && vnet_active == 0` (so it doesn't clobber the QEMU SLIRP default values written by the virtio branch). Idempotent.

**FIX #3 — `r8169_phy_init` non-blocking kick** (~30 LOC in `r8169.cyr`, net ~0 LOC vs the previous version). The block-on-link version landed in commit `b12e25a` had a 300-iteration outer loop × `for j in 0..100000 { }` busy-delay inner loop. On AMD Zen at 3.5 GHz the empty inner loop runs in ~28 µs (not the comment's claimed 10 ms), so the entire "3-second" autoneg budget collapsed to ~8 ms — far shorter than real copper Ethernet autoneg (1.5-3 s per IEEE 802.3 clause 28). New shape: kick `BMCR.ANRESTART`, opportunistic double-read of BMSR (first read clears the IEEE 802.3 §22.2.4.2 latching-low LinkStatus bit, second read returns live state), print `r8169: PHY autoneg kicked; link up` or `r8169: PHY autoneg kicked (link async)` per the live snapshot, stamp CMOS 0x59 = 1 unconditionally on successful BMCR write. The autoneg state machine continues asynchronously in the PHY chassis; TX/RX rings tolerate link-not-yet-up (descriptors sit in the ring until the NIC clocks them out). Matches Linux's PHYLIB async-notifier shape. Outcome enum simplified: 0 = not attempted, 1 = kicked, 3 = MDIO write timeout, 4 = MDIO read timeout. Enum 2 (autoneg-timeout) retired.

**FIX #4 — DHCP OFFER + ACK `chaddr` validation** (~30 LOC in `net.cyr`). Per RFC 2131 §4.1.1, DHCP clients MUST verify `chaddr` matches their hardware address; the previous code only checked `xid` + option-53 (msg-type). With FIX #1 in place, our `chaddr` is finally correct, and the OFFER/ACK reply carries the same `chaddr` — so the check is now meaningful. Added 6-byte compare against the `nic_mac` snapshot in both wait loops. A colliding `xid` from another client on the LAN can no longer hijack our session.

**FIX #5 — DHCP timeout 200 → 800 iter** (~2 LOC in `net.cyr`). Pre-fix budget was 200 `arch_wait()` iterations ≈ 2 seconds. RFC 2131 §4.4.1 specifies 4 seconds minimum × 4 retries with exponential backoff. New budget is ~8 seconds (single attempt — full exponential backoff deferred to a later refinement cycle). Applies to both OFFER + ACK wait loops.

**FIX #6 — RxConfig audit + named constants** (~25 LOC, comment-only delta in `r8169.cyr`). Audited `r8169_init_rx`'s RxConfig program against RTL8168 datasheet §13.2 + Linux `drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/r8169_main.c::rtl_set_rx_mode`. Bit values were already correct: AB (0x08) accept-broadcast + AM (0x04) accept-multicast + APM (0x02) accept-physical-match-to-IDR0..IDR5 + R8169_RXCFG_DEFAULTS (0xE700 = XF unlimited / MXDMA unlimited). Replaced the bare hex literal with named constants and added a per-bit comment block citing the datasheet. AAP (0x01, promisc) deliberately off — matches Linux's `IFF_PROMISC`-gated behavior. No functional change.

**Validation**: `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS; `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 + 5/5 regression cross-check (shell reached on baseline + AHCI + NVMe-partition + combined + ext4-64BIT); `scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh` 1/2 (matches pre-fix 1.32.0 baseline — scenario 1 is pre-existing SLIRP-RX gap, iron-only). Build size 603,784 B (Attempt 94) → **604,096 B production / 604,904 B TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE** (+312 / +584 B).

**Pre-Attempt-95 expected r8169 boot block**: `found at … / MAC=… / chip-rev byte=… / reset OK / PHY autoneg kicked; link up | (link async) / Phase 1 complete / RX ring up / TX ring up`. Pre-Attempt-95 expected DHCP block: `dhcp: DISCOVER / dhcp: OFFER ip=<lan-IP> / dhcp: REQUEST / dhcp: ACK ip=<lan-IP> gw=<gw> mask=<mask>`. CMOS 0x59 expected to flip from 2 (false "autoneg timeout") to 1 ("kicked"); 0x5E expected to flip from 0x01 (background multicast) to 0xFF (broadcast OFFER) or 0xB0 (unicast OFFER to our MAC).

### Added — r8169 PHY init + diagnostic instrumentation (bites B+C, 1.32.1)

The 1.32.1 cycle opens with the planned audit-first sequence per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] + [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]]. Bites A (audit doc extension) + B (CMOS instrumentation) + C (PHY init) all landed same-day; Attempt 94 iron burn ran the same day → PARTIAL (build-on-iron verified, OFFER timeout persists, H1/H7/H8 readback pending — see *Iron — Attempt 94* section below).

**bite A — OFFER-timeout audit extension** (`agnosticos/docs/development/r8169-iron-burn-audit.md` § 10.1-10.8): 261 lines of new audit prose. Re-ranked the 9 pre-burn hypotheses against Attempt 92+93 iron evidence — 6 falsified (H2 reset quirk, H3 MAC garbage, H4 BAR mapping, H6 cache attribute, H9 cross-driver), H5 re-elevated as secondary, **H1 (PHY not configured) ranks top** with H7+H8 as downstream variants of an H1 failure. Line-by-line examination of current `r8169.cyr` against multi-source prior art (Linux `r8169_main.c` + FreeBSD `if_re.c` + OpenBSD `re.c` + NetBSD `re.c` + Haiku + RealTek RTL8168 datasheet §11+§13) confirms: zero PHY-side register writes in current code; OpenBSD's `re_phy_init` is the simplest converged minimum-viable shape. CMOS slot range planning: avoided collision with xhci (0x60-0x6F + 0x70-0x87) and AS1 (0x56-0x57); selected **virgin gap 0x58-0x5F** for r8169 discriminators.

**bite B — CMOS-bank discriminator instrumentation** (~50 LOC in `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` + ~30 LOC in `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`). Seven CMOS slots stamped:

| Slot | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0x58 | r8169_probe completion sentinel (1 = ran to completion) |
| 0x59 | phy_init outcome enum: 0=not attempted, 1=link up, 2=autoneg timeout, 3=BMCR-write timeout, 4=BMSR-read timeout |
| 0x5A | TX send count (saturating byte, 0xFF = ≥255 calls) |
| 0x5B | TX desc 0 high byte (post-mortem; 0x80 = OWN stuck → H7 fires) |
| 0x5C | RX poll count (saturating byte) |
| 0x5D | RX desc 0 high byte (post-mortem; 0x80 = OWN stuck → H8 fires) |
| 0x5E | RX desc 0 buffer first byte (non-zero = DMA visible — disambiguates H8) |
| 0x5F | reserved for future r8169 stamps |

Stamps refresh on every `r8169_poll` invocation (scheduler-idle hot path = constantly fresh). Re-uses existing `xhci_cmos_stamp(slot, val)` primitive at `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr:61-70` — generic two-byte CMOS write handling both standard (0x70/0x71) and extended (0x72/0x73) channels; xhci-prefixed name retained to avoid cross-cutting rename. Kernel-side saturating counters `r8169_tx_send_count` + `r8169_rx_poll_count` avoid the read-modify-write CMOS round-trip on every send/poll. `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` updated with full slot decode + human-readable outcome interpretation; obsolete AS1 #3-#6 + AS2 #1-#6 labels retired in the process (those PMM-diagnostic slots stopped being written by the kernel years ago).

**bite C — PHY init** (~85 LOC in `kernel/core/r8169.cyr`). Three new functions:

- **`r8169_phy_write(reg, val)`** — MDIO write via PHYAR register at MMIO 0x60. Sets flag bit + reg-addr (bits 16:20) + data (bits 0:15); polls for flag-clear completion. 1000-iteration timeout per existing `r8169_probe` reset poll convention.
- **`r8169_phy_read(reg)`** — MDIO read. Clears flag bit + sets reg-addr; polls for flag-set completion; returns data field. 0xFFFF sentinel on timeout.
- **`r8169_phy_init()`** — Reads BMCR, sets autoneg-enable (bit 12) + restart-autoneg (bit 9), clears power-down (bit 11), writes back. Polls BMSR.LinkStatus (bit 2) for up to 300 iterations × ~10ms = ~3s — the OpenBSD/NetBSD-converged autoneg timeout. Stamps CMOS slot 0x59 with per-outcome enum.

Hooked into `r8169_probe()` after the existing CR.RST=1 soft reset, before the new "Phase 1 complete" line. Boot log gains one new line: `r8169: link up` on success or `r8169: no link (autoneg timeout)` on failure. Total r8169 boot block grows from 6 lines to 7.

**Multi-source convergent posture** per [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]]: every primitive cited 4-5 of (Linux / FreeBSD / OpenBSD / NetBSD / Haiku / RTL8168 datasheet). OpenBSD's `re_phy_init` is the primary reference (simplest cross-validated form across all five sources); Linux is one source of many, not the singular reference. Per-chip-rev dispatch table is deliberately deferred (audit § 4 — "NO chip-revision dispatch table" at v1).

**Build delta**: 601,392 B (1.32.0 close, `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1`) → **603,784 B (1.32.1 in-flight, post-B+C)**; +2,392 B / ~80 LOC effective in `r8169.cyr` + ~30 LOC in `scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`. Production build (no `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE`): 602,976 B. `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. QEMU `tcp-listen-smoke` scenario 1 fails as expected (pre-existing SLIRP-RX gap; iron is the validation surface).

### Iron — Attempt 94 2026-05-22 → PARTIAL (audit § 10 framing INVALIDATED — r8169 functional on iron; OFFER-timeout root cause UPSTREAM of NIC; bite C has BMSR-latching-low false-negative)

First iron burn of agnos 1.32.1 (`603,784 B`, `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1`). Shell banner reads `AGNOS shell v1.32.1` — first iron-side confirmation that the bites-B+C build (commit `b12e25a`) ran, not a stale-stick image. (An initial wrong-photo upload at the catalogue step showed `v1.32.0` from the Attempt-93 phone-gallery; corrected to the v1.32.1 still at `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-94-agnos-1.32.1-phy-init-instrumentation-offer-timeout-persists.jpg`.)

**Bite-B CMOS readback delivered direct hypothesis disambiguation** — this is exactly what the instrumentation existed for, and it caught the pre-burn audit pointing at the wrong layer:

| CMOS slot | Value | What it says |
|---|---|---|
| 0x58 | 0x01 | probe ran to completion ✓ |
| 0x59 | 0x02 | decoder says "autoneg timeout" — but contradicted by every other slot below; tracable to **bite-C polling-logic bug**, not PHY failure (see *Bite C* below) |
| 0x5A | 0x02 | `r8169_send` fired twice — DHCP DISCOVER + at least one retry |
| 0x5B | 0x30 | TX desc 0 status high byte: FS+LS set, OWN **cleared** → NIC consumed the descriptor. **H7 FALSIFIED.** |
| 0x5C | 0xFF | RX poll count saturated (≥255) — `r8169_poll` running continuously |
| 0x5D | 0x80 | RX desc 0 OWN=1 (re-armed for next packet, NOT "never written"); cross-decode against 0x5E below |
| 0x5E | 0x01 | RX desc 0 buf first byte = non-zero — **DMA captured a real byte from the wire. H8 FALSIFIED.** |

So **r8169 is functional on archaemenid**: TX descriptors get consumed (egress works), RX DMA captures real bytes (link is live), poll loop is running. The audit § 10 H1/H7/H8 framing pointed at the wrong layer; bite B's instrumentation caught it.

### Fixed — bite C `r8169_phy_init` BMSR-latching-low diagnosis (CARRY-FORWARD to 1.32.2)

CMOS 0x59 = 2 ("autoneg timeout") is a false negative from bite C's autoneg-completion poll. Per IEEE 802.3 §22.2.4.2, **BMSR (PHY register 0x01) bit 2 — Link Status — is latching-low**: once link drops the bit stays 0 until the host reads BMSR (which latches the live value), so the *next* read returns the actual current state. Linux `genphy_update_link` + OpenBSD `re_phy_init` + FreeBSD `re_miibus_readreg` all read BMSR **twice** for this reason.

Bite C's `r8169_phy_init` (`kernel/core/r8169.cyr:186-263`, claimed OpenBSD-converged) appears to read BMSR once per poll iteration. On a cold-boot PHY powered-down through the BIOS handoff, BMSR bit 2 starts latched-low; the first 300 polls inside the 3-second autoneg window all sample the stale latched 0 and the function stamps 0x59=2 / prints `r8169: no link (autoneg timeout)`. The link comes up shortly after — clearly so, since DHCP DISCOVER egresses through r8169 within ms of `r8169_phy_init` returning, and RX DMA captures real bytes. The fix shape (provisional, source-diff vs OpenBSD pending): double-read BMSR in the poll loop AND/OR extend the autoneg-timeout to 5s (Linux uses 5s; OpenBSD uses 5s; bite C uses 3s).

**Not blocking on functional grounds** — the print is misleading but the NIC works regardless. Carry-forward fix into the 1.32.2 cycle alongside the DHCP wiring audit.

### Where the OFFER timeout actually lives — moved UPSTREAM of the NIC

With r8169 functional and bite C's outcome enum invalidated as a NIC-side signal, `dhcp: OFFER timeout` has to be one of:

1. **No DHCP server reachable on archaemenid's current LAN segment** (managed switch / router with DHCP relay vs dumb hub / direct PC link).
2. **OFFER arrives at the NIC but `udp_recv_from` doesn't match it** — port-68 bind, source-port matching, BOOTP `xid` mismatch.
3. **OFFER arrives but BOOTP magic-cookie / option-53 parse fails** — option-blob walk starting from wrong offset.
4. **OFFER arrives but `net.cyr` IP demux drops it** — with `net_ip = 0.0.0.0` pre-lease, broadcast OFFERs (`255.255.255.255 → 255.255.255.255`, client MAC in BOOTP `chaddr`) must be accepted; strict `dst_ip == net_ip` filter would drop them.
5. **DHCP client retransmit/timeout shorter than DHCP server response latency** — RFC 2131 §4.4.1 exponential backoff (4s / 8s / 16s).

### Next step — DHCP end-to-end wiring audit (no Attempt 95 proposed)

Per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] + [[feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent]]: separate audit doc landing as `agnosticos/docs/development/dhcp-end-to-end-audit.md`. Will trace every wire-touching line from `dhcp_init` → BOOTP build → UDP/IP egress → ethernet frame → `nic_send` → `r8169_send` → wire, then back through `r8169_poll` → IP demux → UDP demux → `udp_recv_from` → DHCP OFFER parser. Multi-source convergent vs Linux `net/ipv4/ipconfig.c` (the closest Linux analog — boot-time DHCP without userspace), OpenBSD `dhclient`, Haiku DHCP, and RFC 2131. Bite C BMSR source diff folded in.

### Doc updates this turn

Full Attempt 94 transcript (corrected framing): [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 94](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md). State.md bite D + bite E rows + recent-history bullet + Last refresh + Current scope all re-cast to reflect the audit-§ 10 framing reversal.

### Related debt surfaced this burn

`agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` default-mode preamble + body still display the **agnos-1.30.12 / Attempt-77-prep** xhci-silent-absorb sweep — 3 minor cycles + 9 attempts stale. The new r8169 0x58-0x5F decoder (the one that just delivered the H7/H8 falsification) is gated behind `--verbose`, where it's least likely to be checked first. Canonical [[feedback_script_preambles_are_forward_looking]] trap. Refactor: swap the default-mode current-sweep block to the r8169 NIC post-mortem and demote the xhci silent-absorb summary to verbose. Out-of-scope this turn; offered separately.

### Out of cycle (deferred carry-forward from 1.32.0)

- **i225-V driver port** — pending dedicated Intel-NIC iron (post-archaemenid-migration).
- **BBS + MUD userland consumer apps** — separate standalone repos, out-of-cycle.

## [1.32.0] — 2026-05-22 (Networking arc — kernel TCP/UDP server primitives + DHCP client + r8169 driver Phase 1-4 + iron debut on archaemenid)

### Cycle-close summary

The 1.32.x networking arc closes **feature-complete at 1.32.0**. Carry-forward + driver-level OFFER-timeout debug move to 1.32.1.

**Landed in-cycle**:

- **bite A** — TCP server primitives (`tcp_listen` / `tcp_bind` / `tcp_accept` + passive-open SYN handler + SYN_RCVD state branch + ARP REQUEST handler). ~188 LOC in `net.cyr` + smoke harness.
- **bite F** — UDP server primitives (`udp_bind` / `udp_recv_from` / `udp_send_from` + 8-listener table + per-arrival dispatch in `net_handle_udp`). ~95 LOC in `net.cyr`. Foundation for bite G.
- **bite G** — DHCP client (RFC 2131 DISCOVER → OFFER → REQUEST → ACK; 240-byte BOOTP fixed header + options 53/55/50/54; on ACK sets `net_ip` / `netmask` / `gateway`). ~260 LOC in `net.cyr` + ~5 LOC `main.cyr` boot hook.
- **bite B** — r8169 driver Phases 1-4: Phase 1 (PCI probe + MAC read + soft reset), Phase 2 (16-entry RX descriptor ring + per-buffer 4 KB pages + `r8169_poll`), Phase 3 (16-entry TX descriptor ring + `r8169_send` + TPPoll NPQ kick), Phase 4 (NIC dispatcher `nic_ready` / `nic_send` / `nic_poll` priority r8169 > virtio_net + net.cyr migration of 14 sites). ~400 LOC across `r8169.cyr` + integration.
- **bite D** — iron debut Attempt 92 PARTIAL → Attempt 93 PARTIAL (gate-fix VERIFIED on iron). All six `r8169:` lines + storage trio + GPT + ext4 mount byte-clean on archaemenid through both burns.
- **DHCP gate predicate fix** (`main.cyr:655`) — surfaced by Attempt 92 silence, landed same-day per user direction, validated by Attempt 93. Predicate now `if (vnet_active != 0 || nic_ready() != 0)` — explicit OR with the generic NIC abstraction on the RHS so future backends (i225-V queued, Wi-Fi later) don't force another gate edit. Build 600,520 → 601,392 B; `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. Iron evidence: Attempt 93 transcript shows `dhcp: DISCOVER` line egressing through the r8169 path for the first time. Per [[feedback_prefer_generic_abstraction_at_call_sites]] — captured because this fix took two rounds of user pushback to land in the right shape.
- **Pre-burn audit doc** — `agnosticos/docs/development/r8169-iron-burn-audit.md` landed per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] (9 sections mirroring prior storage-arc audits; H1-H9 hypothesis ranking; success rubric).

**Carry-forward to 1.32.1**:

- **r8169 OFFER-timeout** — Attempt 93 confirmed DISCOVER egresses on iron through the gate-fix path, but no OFFER comes back within the timeout window. This puts H1 (PHY-not-configured / no link), H7 (TX OWN stuck), and H8 (RX OWN stuck) from the pre-burn audit back on the table as the now-reachable failure surface. Driver-level audit + discriminator instrumentation (CMOS-bank stamps per the no-serial-on-iron constraint) + corrective patches are 1.32.1 cycle scope.
- **bite C / i225-V driver** — Intel 2.5GbE family port. Pending dedicated Intel-NIC iron (post-archaemenid-migration ideally).
- **BBS + MUD userland consumer apps** — separate standalone repos (out-of-cycle by design); arrive when wire-end-to-end has DHCP + accept-success on iron.

**Iron evidence at cycle close**: Attempts 92 + 93 byte-clean on r8169 Phase 1-4 + storage trio + ext4 mount + shell launch. MVP gate (kernel + kybernet + agnoshi on iron) green since Attempt 68 / 1.30.9 and **still green at Attempt 93**.

**Build trajectory across cycle**: 578,432 B (1.31.7 close) → 600,432 B (cycle-open + bite A/F/G + bite B Phases 1-4 landed) → 600,520 B (`TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1` variant) → **601,392 B (cycle close, post-gate-fix, `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1`)**. cyrius pin stays on 6.0.1. gnoboot stays on 0.4.2.

### Fixed (post-Attempt 92, validated Attempt 93)

- **DHCP gate predicate** — `main.cyr:655` was gating `dhcp_init()` on `if (vnet_active != 0)` (virtio-net only). On real iron with r8169, `vnet_active == 0` permanently, so the gate never fired and the four expected `dhcp:` lines never printed even though the r8169 driver completed Phase 1-4 cleanly. Iron Attempt 92 (2026-05-22) was a Partial PASS that surfaced this: all six expected `r8169:` lines printed verbatim (`found at 0xFCF04000`, `MAC=176:65:111:12:228:37`, `chip-rev byte=0x87`, `reset OK; Phase 1 complete`, `RX ring up`, `TX ring up`) + storage trio + GPT + ext4 mount all byte-identical to Attempt 91, but DHCP was silent. Root cause: the gate predicate, NOT a driver-internal bug (H1/H7/H8 audit hypotheses all blocked upstream). Fix: `if (vnet_active != 0 || nic_ready() != 0)` — explicit OR with the generic abstraction on the RHS so future NIC backends (i225-V queued) don't force another gate edit (per [[feedback_prefer_generic_abstraction_at_call_sites]] — captured after this fix took two rounds of user pushback to land in the right shape). Build 600,520 → 601,392 B (+872 B reachability shift); `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. **Attempt 93 IRON-VALIDATED 2026-05-22**: `dhcp: DISCOVER` line egresses on iron through the r8169 path; new failure mode is `dhcp: OFFER timeout` (driver-level H1/H7/H8 surface — 1.32.1 cycle scope).

### Networking arc — bite B Phase 5 (pre-burn audit): `r8169-iron-burn-audit.md` landed

Per [[feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work]] — every iron-burn proposal carries a written line-by-line audit FIRST. The audit for Attempt 92+ landed at [`agnosticos/docs/development/r8169-iron-burn-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/r8169-iron-burn-audit.md). 9 sections mirroring the prior storage-arc audits (`ahci-iron-burn-audit.md` / `usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` / `ext2-iron-burn-audit.md`):

1. Scope — Phases 1-4 in one burn + retroactive validation of bites A/F/G via real-iron (SLIRP out of the loop).
2. Coverage matrix — what each Phase delivers.
3. Hypothesis ranking — 9 hypotheses (H1-H9) ranked by iron-specific risk; HIGH = H1 (PHY not configured → link absent → RX/TX silent but Phase 1-3 probe lines correct); MEDIUM = H2 (chip-revision reset quirk) / H7-H8 (TX or RX OWN never clears); LOW = H3-H6 / H9. Each hypothesis carries a triage column.
4. What NOT to do — no MSI / chip-rev dispatch / ASPM / jumbo / RX-csum-offload / VLAN / IRQ-driven / i225-V bundling / extra instrumentation / PHY init.
5. Success rubric — Full PASS (6 r8169 lines + DHCP ACK if cabled + bite-A accept-success), Partial (H1/H3/H7/H8 outcomes), Falsified (boot doesn't reach shell — H2/H6/H9).
6. Mitigations in code (recap).
7. No CMOS stamps reserved for this burn (boot log is FB-visible; no hang risk in current code; budget reserved for harder-to-diagnose Phase 6+ work).
8. Multi-source prior art table — primary ref + cross-validation refs per primitive.
9. Audit disposition — ready to burn; iron-burn checklist for user; pass/partial/falsified next-document handoff.

**Iron-burn checklist (for the user at burn time)**:

1. Confirm `agnos/build/agnos` is current (600,432 B production / 600,520 B with TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE).
2. `sh scripts/install-usb.sh --update` from agnosticos repo root.
3. (Optional) Connect Ethernet cable to archaemenid's onboard NIC for full validation.
4. Boot archaemenid from USB.
5. Capture boot-log photo.
6. Classify per § 5 rubric.

This audit completes bite B's code authoring side. Attempt 92+ iron burn is the final cycle item; on PASS it closes bite B + retroactively closes the bite A scenario-1 + bite G OFFER timeout deferrals.

### Networking arc — bite B Phases 2 + 3 + 4: r8169 RX/TX rings + NIC dispatcher (code complete)

Phase 2 (RX descriptor ring + per-buffer pages + poll), Phase 3 (TX descriptor ring + send), Phase 4 (NIC dispatcher in r8169.cyr + net.cyr migration). All three landed in the same cut — none individually need iron between them; Phase 5 iron-burn validates the bundle. Multi-source convergent per `agnosticos/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md` § 1.4.

#### Phase 2 — RX ring + buffers + poll (~110 LOC in `kernel/core/r8169.cyr`)

**Descriptor layout** (converged across all five refs — Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/NetBSD/Haiku — and the RTL8168 datasheet §6.7):

```
offset 0:  status (u32) — OWN[31] | EOR[30] | FS[29] | LS[28] | length[13:0]
offset 4:  vlan (u32)
offset 8:  buf_addr_lo (u32)
offset 12: buf_addr_hi (u32)
```

OWN=1 → NIC owns (RX: empty waiting-to-fill; TX: ready-to-send). OWN=0 → driver owns. EOR set on last descriptor (NIC wraps to descriptor 0).

**Memory layout**:

- Descriptor ring: `pmm_alloc()` returns a 4 KB page (page-aligned = 4096-aligned = 256-aligned, satisfying the spec's descriptor-ring alignment constraint). 16 descriptors × 16 B = 256 B used, rest of page wasted.
- Per-descriptor buffer: separate `pmm_alloc()` page per descriptor. 4 KB page, 2 KB used (covers 1500 MTU + Eth + VLAN + slack). 16 RX buffers + 16 TX = 32 pages = 128 KB of buffer memory.
- Ring size: 16 entries (Linux defaults 256 for perf; BBS/MUD-class workloads fit easily in 16). Power-of-two so `(idx + 1) & 0x0F` wrap is one AND op.

**Init sequence** (`r8169_init_rx`):

1. `pmm_alloc` ring page; zero it.
2. For each of 16 descriptors: `pmm_alloc` 4 KB buffer page, store its phys in `r8169_rx_bufs[i]`, set descriptor status = OWN | BUF_SIZE (= 2048), set buf_addr_lo/hi from buffer phys. EOR bit set on i==15.
3. Program RDSAR_LO/HI (offsets 0xE4/0xE8) with ring phys base.
4. Set RxConfig (offset 0x44) = `0xE700 | AB | AM | APM` (FIFO/DMA thresh unlimited + accept broadcast/multicast/our-phys; no promisc).
5. Set RMS (Rx Max packet Size, 16-bit at 0xDA) = `0x05F3` (1523 — 1500 MTU + headroom).
6. Set CR.RE (bit 3 at 0x37); preserve other CR bits.

**`r8169_poll(buf, maxlen)`**: scan `r8169_rx_ring[r8169_rx_idx]`; if OWN=1 return 0 (still NIC-owned); else read length (status & 0x3FFF), strip 4-byte FCS (RTL8168 reports FCS as part of length per datasheet §6.7), copy from buffer to caller's `buf`, re-arm descriptor (OWN=1 + preserve EOR on i==15), advance `r8169_rx_idx`.

#### Phase 3 — TX ring + send (~85 LOC)

Symmetric to Phase 2:

- `r8169_init_tx`: ring page + 16 buffer pages; descriptors start OWN=0 (driver-owned, empty). Program TNPDS_LO/HI (offsets 0x20/0x24). Set TxConfig (offset 0x40) = `0x03000700` (IFG=3 standard, DMA burst=7 unlimited). Set MTPS (Max Tx Packet Size, 8-bit at 0xEC) = `0x3B` (59 × 128 = 7552 bytes, ample for 1500 MTU). Set CR.TE (bit 2 at 0x37).
- `r8169_send(buf, len)`: cap len at 2048; check next TX descriptor — if OWN=1 return -1 (ring full); else copy `buf[0..len]` to `r8169_tx_bufs[r8169_tx_idx]`; set descriptor status = OWN | FS | LS | length (single-segment frame); preserve EOR on i==15; write TPPoll (offset 0x38) bit 6 (NPQ kick = `0x40`); advance `r8169_tx_idx`.

#### Phase 4 — NIC dispatcher + net.cyr migration (~40 LOC in r8169.cyr + ~15 sites in net.cyr)

Three new wrapper functions in `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` route net.cyr's egress/ingress through whichever NIC is up:

- **`nic_ready() → 0/1`** — replaces `vnet_active` gate. Returns 1 if r8169 is initialized OR virtio_net is active; 0 if neither.
- **`nic_send(buf, len)`** — priority: r8169 (real iron) > virtio_net (QEMU paravirt). On iron, virtio_net is absent so r8169 wins; in QEMU, r8169 is absent so virtio_net wins. No-NIC returns -1.
- **`nic_poll(buf, maxlen)`** — same priority. r8169 tried first; if 0 bytes (no packet pending), fall through to virtio_net.

**net.cyr migration**:

- `agnos.cyr` include reorder: `core/r8169.cyr` now precedes `core/net.cyr` so net.cyr can reference `nic_send`/`nic_poll`/`nic_ready`.
- 6 sites changed: `virtio_net_send(...)` → `nic_send(...)` in `arp_request` (line 107), `udp_send` (119), `udp_send_from` (133), `net_handle_arp` ARP-reply (439), `tcp_send_pkt` (648).
- 1 site changed: `virtio_net_poll(...)` → `nic_poll(...)` in `net_poll` (472).
- 7 sites changed: `if (vnet_active == 0) { ... }` → `if (nic_ready() == 0) { ... }` across `arp_request`, `udp_send`, `udp_send_from`, `tcp_send_pkt`, `net_handle_arp`, `net_poll`, and the `dhcp_init` egress gate.

#### Wiring in `kernel/core/main.cyr`

`r8169_probe()` was a bare call after the boot path landed Phase 1. Now wrapped:

```cyrius
if (r8169_probe() == 1) {
    r8169_init_rx();
    r8169_init_tx();
}
```

Silent no-op in QEMU (probe returns 0 → no Realtek device). On archaemenid iron: probe returns 1 → ring init runs → driver fully up before the existing `pci_find(0x1AF4, 0x1000)` virtio-net probe runs (which will return -1 on iron since no virtio device, leaving r8169 as sole NIC backend).

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` **4/4 PASS**. Build 595,424 → **600,432 B** (+5,008 B for Phases 2-4 combined). Crosses 600 KB.
- QEMU boot smoke (with TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1): `VirtIO-net: MAC=...` → `Net: 10.0.2.15/24 gw 10.0.2.2` → `dhcp: DISCOVER` → `dhcp: OFFER timeout` (same SLIRP-RX gap as before). `r8169:` lines absent as expected. **The DISCOVER print confirms `nic_send` correctly dispatched through `virtio_net_send` on the no-r8169 QEMU path.** No regression on existing kernel paths.
- **Iron burn (Attempt 92+) PENDING** — will validate the full chain on archaemenid:
  - Phase 1 four lines (chip ID + MAC + reset OK)
  - Phase 2 line: `r8169: RX ring up (16 desc × 2KB buf)`
  - Phase 3 line: `r8169: TX ring up (16 desc × 2KB buf)`
  - Then bite-A scenario-1 accept-success path validates end-to-end (host TCP probe → r8169 RX → kernel passive-open SYN handler → SYN+ACK back via r8169 TX → established conn → banner sent → close). DHCP exchange validates UDP both ways via r8169.

#### What's still PENDING IRON for bite B

- **Phase 5**: `r8169-iron-burn-audit.md` (pre-burn audit doc per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work`) + Attempt 92+ iron burn + photo capture + transcript landing.
- Multi-queue support, MSI-X interrupt routing, ASPM workarounds, full chip-revision dispatch table — all DEFERRED until a real consumer (perf workload, second-board iron) surfaces demand. v1 stays single-queue / polling / no-ASPM / single-revision per the audit doc § 1.3 "AGNOS at v1" notes.

### Networking arc — bite B Phase 1: r8169 PCI discovery + MAC read + reset (code complete, iron-anchored)

Realtek RTL8111/8168 family Ethernet driver, Phase 1. New file `kernel/core/r8169.cyr` (~150 LOC). Multi-source convergent port per [`agnosticos/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md) § 1: Linux `r8169_main.c` + FreeBSD `if_re.c` + OpenBSD `re.c` + NetBSD `re.c` + Haiku rtl8169 + RTL8168/8111 datasheet.

#### Iron anchor (queried via `lspci`/sysfs on archaemenid, no burn needed)

Per [[feedback_archaemenid_is_dev_host]] — chip ID + BAR layout + MAC are discoverable directly from the dev host's Linux:

- **PCI BDF**: `0000:01:00.0`
- **Vendor:Device**: `10ec:8168` rev 0x15 (RTL8111/8168/8211/8411)
- **Subsystem**: `10ec:0123`
- **Class**: `0x020000` (Ethernet)
- **Linux interface**: `enp1s0`, driver `r8169`
- **MAC**: `b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25`
- **BAR0**: I/O port `0xF000` (256 B)
- **BAR2**: MMIO **`0xFCF04000`** (4 KB, 64-bit) ← driver's primary mapping target
- **BAR4**: MMIO `0xFCF00000` (16 KB, MSI-X table region, Phase 2+ scope)

#### What landed in `kernel/core/r8169.cyr`

- **PCI device-ID table**: 0x8168 (primary), 0x8169, 0x8161. v1 scope is the most-common modern variants; chip-rev dispatch table (Linux's ~50-entry `r8169_pci_tbl`) deferred until a second iron board surfaces with a new ID per the extract-on-2nd-consumer pattern.
- **Register-offset constants** (converged across all four refs): `IDR0=0x00`, `TXCONFIG=0x40`, `RXCONFIG=0x44`, `CR=0x37`. CR bit constants: `RST=0x10`, `RE=0x08`, `TE=0x04`.
- **MMIO accessors**: `r8169_mmio_read8` / `write8` / `read32` — mirrors nvme.cyr/ahci.cyr "no load64 on MMIO" convention.
- **`r8169_find_pci()`** — iterates 0x8168 → 0x8169 → 0x8161 via `pci_find`. Returns idx or -1.
- **`r8169_probe()`** — full Phase 1 sequence:
  1. `pci_find` for one of the three device IDs.
  2. BAR discovery: BAR2 first (modern RTL811x MMIO), BAR4 fallback (newer chips), refuse if both zero (I/O-port-only chip is out of scope).
  3. `pci_enable_bus_master_idx(idx)` — same call-shape nvme/xhci use.
  4. Cache state: `r8169_present`, `r8169_pci_idx`, `r8169_mmio_base`.
  5. `vmm_remap_uc_2mb(mmio)` — UC remap of the BAR region.
  6. Read 6-byte MAC at MMIO offset 0 into `r8169_mac[8]`.
  7. Read TxConfig high byte as chip-revision hint into `r8169_chip_rev` (full mac_version dispatch table is Phase 2+).
  8. Reset: write `CR.RST=1` (0x10) to offset 0x37, poll ≤1000 reads for bit-clear. Timings per OpenBSD's `re.c` (cheapest implementable; per spec).
  9. Print summary lines: `r8169: found at <mmio>`, `r8169: MAC=<6 bytes>`, `r8169: chip-rev byte=0x<N>`, `r8169: reset OK; Phase 1 complete (RX/TX rings PENDING IRON)`.

#### Wired in

- `kernel/agnos.cyr`: new `include "core/r8169.cyr"` after `core/net.cyr` line.
- `kernel/core/main.cyr`: `r8169_probe();` call site added immediately before the existing `pci_find(0x1AF4, 0x1000)` virtio-net probe. Silent no-op in QEMU (no Realtek device); on archaemenid iron the four `r8169:` lines should appear at boot.

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` **4/4 PASS**. Build 593,096 → **595,424 B** (+2,328 B for r8169 Phase 1).
- QEMU boot under virtio-blk-only smoke: r8169 silent no-op as expected (no Realtek device in the QEMU config). Boot reaches `agnos>` shell prompt — no regression on existing stack (nvme/ahci/usb-ms/virtio-blk/net/etc. all unchanged).
- **Iron burn (Attempt 92+) PENDING** — will validate that:
  - `r8169: found at 4243210240` (= 0xFCF04000)
  - `r8169: MAC=176:65:111:12:228:37` (= decimal bytes of `b0:41:6f:0c:e4:25`)
  - `r8169: chip-rev byte=0x<N>` matches the RTL8168* rev-15 family entry from Linux's mac_version table
  - `r8169: reset OK; Phase 1 complete (RX/TX rings PENDING IRON)`

#### Phases 2-3 (RX + TX rings) — next bites

Per the convergent-shape table in audit doc § 1.4:

- **Phase 2** (~250 LOC): RX descriptor ring (64 entries × 16 B at 256-B alignment) + IRQ handler + first packet reception. Validatable by sending an ARP request from the gateway and observing the AGNOS log line for the response.
- **Phase 3** (~250 LOC): TX descriptor ring (same shape) + send path. Validatable by `yo`-style ICMP echo: send echo-request, gateway responds, AGNOS reads response.
- **Phase 4** (~100 LOC): Integration with `kernel/core/net.cyr`'s existing TCP/UDP layer — multi-NIC dispatch.
- **Phase 5** (~200 prose): `r8169-iron-burn-audit.md` + Attempt 92+ iron burn.

Phases 2-4 are also code-writeable from the convergent prior-art reference set without needing iron between phases; iron-burn validation can batch them at Phase 5 time. Per [[feedback_driver_code_is_the_bite]] — write the code, burn validates.

### Networking arc — bite F: UDP server-side primitives landed (code complete, regression-clean)

Mirror of bite A's TCP server pattern, scoped to UDP. Foundation for bite G (DHCP) — DHCP runs over UDP and consumes the new `udp_bind`/`udp_recv_from` surface directly. Smaller than TCP server (no state machine; UDP is connectionless) — ~95 LOC net.

#### What landed in `kernel/core/net.cyr`

- **UDP listener table** — `var udp_listeners[48]` (= 384 bytes = 8 listeners × 48 bytes each, per [[feedback_cyrius_var_array_u64_units]]). Per-entry layout: state, local_port, buf_ptr (kmalloc'd 256 B), buf_len, peer_ip, peer_port.
- **`udp_find_listener(port) → conn_id`** — scan table for state==bound + matching local_port.
- **`udp_bind(port) → listener_id`** — refuse duplicate-bind; cap at 8 listeners; kmalloc the per-listener RX buffer.
- **`udp_recv_from(listener_id, buf, maxlen, src_ip_out, src_port_out) → bytes`** — non-blocking drain. Both out-params may be 0 to skip writing them.
- **`udp_send_from(src_ip, dst_ip, src_port, dst_port, data, len)`** — egress variant with explicit src_ip override (DHCP needs src_ip=0.0.0.0 since the kernel doesn't have an IP yet).
- **`net_handle_udp` extended** — now accepts `src_ip` arg, parses src_port + dst_port from the UDP header, looks up listener by dst_port, deposits data + peer metadata into the listener's buffer. Legacy `net_udp_buf` global path preserved (single-consumer fallback). Call site in `net_poll` updated.

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. Build 582,632 → **585,336 B** (+2,704 B).
- No smoke harness yet — bite G (DHCP) consumes this surface as its first real consumer; their joint smoke is what validates F end-to-end.

### Networking arc — bite G: DHCP client landed (code complete, smoke caveat per bite A)

Kernel-side DHCP client (RFC 2131 DISCOVER → OFFER → REQUEST → ACK) in `kernel/core/net.cyr`. Removes the hardcoded `net_init(ip4(10,0,2,15), …)` as the load-bearing IP source; instead the kernel asks the DHCP server (SLIRP in QEMU; iron gateway later) for an address at boot. On DHCP failure (timeout / NAK), `net_init`'s pre-set fallback stays in place — the kernel always has a workable address.

Originally hypothesized to also fix bite A's scenario-1 SLIRP smoke gap as a side effect. **That hypothesis was falsified at smoke time** (see § Verification below). DHCP DISCOVER egress works; SLIRP doesn't deliver the OFFER back — same QEMU/virtio-net inbound-RX gap that bite A surfaced. Real-iron NICs (bite B/C) take SLIRP out of the loop entirely; both bite A's accept-success and bite G's full DHCP cycle iron-validate together once a real-NIC driver lands.

#### What landed (~260 LOC in `kernel/core/net.cyr`)

- **`dhcp_xid`** — transaction ID, timer-driven random (`(timer_ticks * 64017 + 31337) & 0xFFFFFFFF`).
- **`dhcp_pkt_buf[300]`** — module-global TX packet scratch (DHCP packets are 240 B fixed BOOTP header + options).
- **`dhcp_build_packet(buf, xid, opts, opts_len)`** — fills the 240-byte BOOTP header: op=BOOTREQUEST, htype=ETH, hlen=6, xid, flags=broadcast (0x8000), chaddr=`vnet_mac`, magic cookie at offset 236, options at offset 240. Returns 240 + opts_len.
- **`dhcp_find_option(opts, opts_len, tag) → data_offset`** — RFC 2132 option walker; returns -1 on not-found or malformed. Handles pad (0), end (255), and per-option `tag/len/data` records.
- **`dhcp_load_u32_be` / `dhcp_store_u32_be`** — big-endian u32 helpers.
- **`dhcp_print_ip(ip)`** — dotted-quad pretty-print for boot log.
- **`dhcp_init()`** — full state machine: udp_bind(68) → DISCOVER (53=1, 55=[1,3,6]) → wait OFFER (200 ticks × ~10ms) → parse offered_ip + server_id → REQUEST (53=3, 50=offered_ip, 54=server_id) → wait ACK → parse netmask (1) + gateway (3) → set `net_ip`/`net_netmask`/`net_gateway`.

#### Wired into `kernel/core/main.cyr`

`dhcp_init()` runs unconditionally (no build flag) after scheduler activation + interrupt enable, just before the `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE`-gated bite-A smoke hook. On DHCP success, `net_ip` reflects the SLIRP/LAN-assigned address. On failure, `net_init`'s fallback (10.0.2.15 / 10.0.2.2 / 255.255.255.0) stays.

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. Build 585,336 → **593,096 B** (+7,760 B for DHCP).
- Smoke (`TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1 sh scripts/build.sh + sh scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh`): kernel logs `dhcp: DISCOVER` then `dhcp: OFFER timeout` (no SLIRP reply). Instrumented `net_handle_udp` with a per-arrival `udp_rx: src_port=... dst_port=... len=...` print to confirm whether SLIRP sent anything inbound — **zero udp_rx lines** in the boot log over the full 200-tick wait window. **No inbound UDP at all from SLIRP**, same root-cause as the bite A scenario-1 hostfwd-inbound gap. Diagnostic since removed (per the no-instrumentation discipline).
- Bite A's smoke result unchanged: scenario 2 (listen-no-connect) still PASS; scenario 1 (accept-one) still FAIL on the same SLIRP-inbound floor.

#### Tracking — what's open at the SLIRP layer

`feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` says no further QEMU instrumentation without a written line-by-line audit FIRST. The bite-A/F/G code is structurally complete; the deferred validation surface waits for either (a) a focused SLIRP/virtio-net RX investigation (audit-doc-first) OR (b) bite B/C iron-NIC drivers that route around SLIRP entirely. Cycle plan: keep moving on real cycle work; revisit if/when SLIRP debug becomes the bottleneck.

### Networking arc — bite A: TCP server-side primitives landed (kernel code complete, regression-clean)

Per the user's "lets keep it moving" direction after the lean cycle-open, smallest-first kernel bite A landed. The four sub-bites that compose bite A (state constants + tcp_listen/tcp_bind/tcp_accept allocation + tcp_find_listen scan + passive-open SYN handler with SYN_RCVD→ESTABLISHED transition + flags-field metadata bit packing) all integrate cleanly into the existing `kernel/core/net.cyr` (532 → ~720 LOC, +188 LOC net). Plus a smoke-hook in `kernel/core/main.cyr` (TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE-gated, ~40 LOC) + new test harness `scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh` (~180 LOC bash). All smaller than the audit's 300-500 LOC estimate per [`agnosticos/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md) § 3.3.

#### Bite (A1) — TCP_STATE_LISTEN / TCP_STATE_SYN_RCVD + tcp_state_name updates

Two new state constants: `TCP_STATE_LISTEN = 5`, `TCP_STATE_SYN_RCVD = 6`. Plus existing-state constant names exported as module-globals so new code paths reference names rather than bare integers (`TCP_STATE_CLOSED=0` etc.). Plus flag-field metadata bit constants: `TCP_FLAG_IS_LISTENING = 0x100` (bit 8), `TCP_FLAG_PASSIVE_OPEN = 0x200` (bit 9), `TCP_FLAG_ACCEPTED = 0x400` (bit 10); `parent_listen_id` packed at bits 16-23. `tcp_state_name(state, buf)` extended with `LISTEN` (6 bytes) and `SYN_RCVD` (8 bytes) cases.

#### Bite (A2) — tcp_listen() / tcp_bind() / tcp_find_listen()

`tcp_listen(port) → listen_id`: allocate next conn slot (gated on `tcp_conn_count < 8` cap + duplicate-bind check via `tcp_find_listen`); set state=LISTEN, src_port=port, dst_port=0 wildcard, dst_ip=0 wildcard; flags = `TCP_FLAG_IS_LISTENING`; return slot index or -1. `tcp_bind(port, ip) → listen_id`: v1 thin wrapper around `tcp_listen` (bind+listen merged; ip arg unused since we listen on `net_ip` only). `tcp_find_listen(listen_port) → conn_id`: scan conn table for state==LISTEN entries with matching `src_port`.

#### Bite (A3) — passive-open SYN-fallback in net_handle_tcp

When `tcp_find_conn(src_port, dst_port, src_ip)` returns no active match, the new fall-through checks: is this a pure SYN (`flags & 0x02 == 0x02` AND `flags & 0x10 == 0`)? If yes, scan for a LISTEN entry on the packet's dst_port via `tcp_find_listen(dst_port)`. On match, fall into the passive-open allocator (bite A4). On no LISTEN, the existing drop returns 0.

#### Bite (A4) — passive-open allocator + SYN_RCVD state branch

On SYN-to-LISTEN match: allocate new conn slot (tcp_conn_count++ if under cap), populate (src_port=listener's port, dst_port=peer's port, dst_ip=peer's IP, seq=timer-driven ISN, ack=peer's seq+1, rx_buf=kmalloc(256)), state=SYN_RCVD, meta = `TCP_FLAG_PASSIVE_OPEN | (parent_listen_id << 16)`. Send SYN+ACK via `tcp_send_pkt(new_id, 0x12, 0, 0)`. Advance seq by 1 (SYN consumes one sequence number).

New state==6 (SYN_RCVD) branch in net_handle_tcp: expect peer ACK; validate `ack == our_seq` (the isn+1 we set after sending SYN+ACK); on match, store state=ESTABLISHED and fall through into existing state==2 ESTABLISHED branch so any data/FIN in the same packet gets handled. On RST, drop to CLOSED.

#### Bite (A5) — tcp_accept(listen_id) non-blocking pop

`tcp_accept(listen_id) → conn_id`: validate listen_id is in-range + is actually a LISTEN slot. Scan conn table for entries where state==ESTABLISHED, `flags & TCP_FLAG_PASSIVE_OPEN` set, `flags & TCP_FLAG_ACCEPTED` clear, and `parent_listen_id` (bits 16-23) matches. On match: set ACCEPTED bit, return conn_id. Else return -1 (non-blocking; userland polls).

#### ARP request handler (extension to net_handle_arp)

Pre-bite-A, `net_handle_arp` only processed REPLY (oper=2). Added REQUEST (oper=1) handler: parse target IP at offset 38; if matches `net_ip`, build + send ARP REPLY (oper=2, sender HW = `vnet_mac`, sender IP = `net_ip`, target HW = requester's MAC, target IP = requester's IP). Without this, SLIRP / any peer can't deliver inbound TCP because they don't know the guest's MAC. ~30 LOC delta.

#### Flag-field metadata preservation in existing ESTABLISHED branch

Pre-bite-A: `store64(cb + 72, flags);` clobbered the entire 64-bit field with the 8-bit received-flags byte. Post-bite-A this would overwrite the IS_LISTENING/PASSIVE_OPEN/ACCEPTED/parent_listen_id metadata. Fixed: `var old_meta = load64(cb + 72) & 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFF00; store64(cb + 72, old_meta | (flags & 0xFF));` — preserve upper bits.

#### Smoke surface — `scripts/tcp-listen-smoke.sh`

New test harness mirroring `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` shape. Two scenarios:

- **Scenario 1 (accept-one)**: boot kernel with `TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1`, run python3 TCP probe against `qemu`'s SLIRP hostfwd, expect kernel log "tcp_accept: conn_id=" + host receives "AGNOS 1.32.0 tcp_listen smoke" banner.
- **Scenario 2 (listen-no-connect)**: same boot but no host probe, expect "tcp_listen smoke: no connection within timeout" line — proves listener is alive but doesn't spuriously accept.

**Smoke result: 1/2 PASS**:

- ✅ **Scenario 2 PASS** — kernel reaches scheduler → smoke hook fires → `tcp_listen(8080) lid=0` → 8-second wait window elapses → "no connection within timeout" prints → boot continues to shell. Validates the LISTEN slot allocation, the wait loop, and the no-spurious-accept invariant.
- ⚠ **Scenario 1 FAIL** — kernel sees ZERO inbound packets during the smoke window (instrumented `any_packet=0` confirmed). Root cause is QEMU SLIRP's hostfwd not delivering inbound TCP to the guest's virtio-net under this kernel's configuration — a pre-existing networking-integration gap, NOT a bite-A code defect (the LISTEN/passive-open/ACCEPT logic compiles + integrates clean and is provably reachable per scenario 2). Tried mitigations: gratuitous ARP from kernel at smoke-start, ARP REQUEST handler in `net_handle_arp` — neither resolved the inbound delivery gap. Deferred to either (a) a deeper SLIRP-config debug pass (likely needs DHCP-from-guest emulation, SLIRP `guestaddr=` parameter, or virtio-net F_MAC/F_GUEST_TSO4 negotiation review), OR (b) iron testing once a real-NIC driver lands in bite B/C (r8169/i225-V take SLIRP out of the loop entirely).

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS. Production build: **582,632 B** (vs 1.31.7 close at 578,432 B = +4,200 B for the new code).
- Smoke build (TCP_LISTEN_SMOKE=1): 582,632 + ~700 B for the smoke hook.
- Existing `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` regression — not re-run this turn (bite A touches `net.cyr`/`main.cyr`/`build.sh` only, no FS surface).

#### Tracking — what's still open at the smoke layer

The "scenario 1 accept-one" deferral isn't a bite-A code blocker but it IS the natural validation path. Two follow-ups for when iron time / SLIRP-debug time is available:

- **SLIRP-inbound investigation** — orthogonal to bite A; would unblock scenario-1 validation in QEMU. Low priority since bite B/C iron-NIC drivers validate the same code path.
- **Iron-confirm via VirtIO-net under archaemenid** — same code, same SLIRP-equivalent... actually iron-on-archaemenid is virtio-net under-QEMU-equivalent, so probably hits the same gap. Real validation comes with r8169/i225-V driver (bite B/C) routing through a real-NIC.

### Networking arc — cycle-open (lean: VERSION bump + multi-source prior-art audit, no code touches yet)

Cycle theme: **networking** — kernel server-side TCP primitives + real-iron NIC drivers, with **BBS + MUD as the userland consumer apps** that prove the wire end-to-end (early-90s revival aesthetic). Storage + filesystem arc closed at 1.31.7 / Iron Attempt 91; this cut opens the next ring on the device-class spiral.

**Cycle-open is intentionally lean** per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` and the user-stated discipline "track items we still need to write work for but wait until we are on that particular iron." All code touches stay pending until the relevant iron is in hand; this cut delivers the planning surface (audit doc + bite table + tracking framing) only. No `net.cyr` changes, no new driver files, no scaffold beyond docs.

#### Cycle-open scope (this cut)

- **VERSION 1.31.7 → 1.32.0** via canonical `scripts/version-bump.sh` (auto-regenerates `kernel/version.cyr` with new byte-length calculations; updates `kernel/agnos.cyr` comment; bumps `docs/development/roadmap.md` header; adds `## [1.32.0]` section in this CHANGELOG; updates state.md Released / Last-refresh).
- **`agnosticos/docs/development/network-arc-prior-art.md`** — multi-source convergent audit per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`. Sections: (1) r8169-family NIC driver references (Linux `drivers/net/ethernet/realtek/r8169_main.c` + FreeBSD `if_re.c` + OpenBSD `re.c` + NetBSD `re.c` + Haiku + RealTek datasheets), (2) i225-V driver references (Linux `drivers/net/ethernet/intel/igc/` + FreeBSD `igc/`), (3) TCP server-primitives references (Linux `net/ipv4/tcp_ipv4.c` + BSD socket impl + xinu listen-accept micro-impl as the simplest reference), (4) BBS/MUD wire-protocol references (RFC 854 Telnet + RFC 1184 LINEMODE + telnet option negotiation basics + DikuMUD-family protocol shape).
- **state.md § 1.32.x cycle (OPEN)** — tracking surface for bites + PENDING IRON labels per user discipline.
- **roadmap.md row 16** — networking arc OPEN entry with the same tracking surface.
- **No code touches**: `net.cyr` unchanged at 532 LOC, `virtio_net.cyr` unchanged at 148 LOC. `build/agnos` unchanged structurally (only `version_str` literals changed; size delta within byte-counter precision).

#### Existing networking baseline (kernel-side, pre-cycle)

What the kernel already ships, surfaced for the audit baseline:

- **TCP client-side**: `tcp_connect(dst_ip, dst_port, src_port)`, `tcp_send(conn_id, data, len)`, `tcp_recv(conn_id, buf, maxlen)`, `tcp_close(conn_id)`, `tcp_find_conn(src_port, dst_port, src_ip)`, full SYN/ACK/FIN state machine + checksum. ~532 LOC in `kernel/core/net.cyr`.
- **TCP server-side**: ❌ **NONE** — no `tcp_listen`, no `tcp_bind`, no `tcp_accept`, no incoming-SYN handler that creates new connections from a listening socket. This is the first concrete kernel-shape gap the BBS/MUD apps surface.
- **UDP**: `udp_build`, `udp_send` (egress). UDP ingress + bind path needed for DNS (already named in `dig` planning entry).
- **IP**: basic IPv4 (no IPv6).
- **Real-iron NIC**: ❌ **NONE** — `virtio_net.cyr` (QEMU-only) is the entire NIC surface. r8169 + i225-V drivers both pending.

#### Planned bites (smallest-first; ALL "PENDING IRON" until archaemenid time available)

Pinned-but-not-scheduled — order is smallest-first inside each tier, but no calendar:

| # | Bite | Iron-validatable? | LOC estimate | Status |
|---|------|-------------------|--------------|--------|
| A | **TCP server primitives** — `tcp_listen(port)` / `tcp_accept(listen_id)` / passive-open SYN handler that walks the existing conn table allocator instead of routing via `tcp_connect`. Multi-connection mux already exists (`tcp_find_conn`). | QEMU-validatable; iron-confirmable via VirtIO-net under archaemenid (no NIC driver dependency). | ~300–500 LOC delta to `net.cyr` | **PENDING audit + archaemenid time** |
| B | **r8169 driver** — Phase 1 PCI discovery + MAC read + minimal init; Phase 2 RX descriptor ring + IRQ; Phase 3 TX descriptor ring + send path. Multi-source converged from §1 of the audit doc. | **Iron-only** (real-iron primary; archaemenid presumed-r8169 per user). | ~600–1000 LOC + audit doc | **PENDING archaemenid NIC enumeration + iron time** |
| C | **i225-V driver** — Phase 1-3 mirror of r8169 sequence; targets the secondary Beelink-SER variant family + future Intel iron. | **Iron-only**. | ~700–1100 LOC | **PENDING dedicated Intel-NIC iron + post-r8169 closeout** |
| D | **Iron debut burn** — first AGNOS LAN packet on archaemenid: ICMP egress through the new NIC driver to the gateway, response receive, RTT print. Pairs with `yo` planning entry's "LAN-against-iron when NIC driver lands" gate. | **Iron-only** (Attempt 92+ slot). | ~50 LOC test surface | **PENDING bites A + B closeout** |
| E | **Cycle-close sweep + Attempt 92+ transcript** — state/roadmap/iron-log sweep + photo capture. | n/a (doc-roll). | n/a | **PENDING bite D PASS** |

#### Userland consumer apps (parallel, separate repos — NOT kernel scope)

- **BBS server** — standalone repo, name TBD (English-wordplay or Polynesian per `feedback_naming_lanes`). Telnet/raw-TCP listener; user accounts; message boards; file areas; ANSI MOTD via the future `cyrius-img-art` tool's 8/16-color ANSI output. Consumes ext4 (already iron-validated 1.31.7) for persistent storage.
- **MUD server** — standalone repo, name TBD. Same TCP listener substrate; room-based world model; character state persistence; combat / dialogue / inventory loops. DikuMUD-family protocol shape as the reference per the audit doc.
- **`cyrius-img-art`** — image→ANSI converter (chafa-equivalent), 8/16-color tier 1, 256/truecolor "high bands" post-v1. Captured in `agnosticos/docs/development/planning/shared-crates.md` § Image-to-ANSI family. Drives the BBS/MUD aesthetic but ships its own cycle.

All three are **out-of-cycle from agnos 1.32.x** — they live as their own repos in the standalone-repos pattern (parallel to agnoshi), open their own cycles, and consume the kernel networking surface as ABI.

#### Tracking discipline (user-stated 2026-05-22)

> *"we will track the items we still need to write work for but will wait until we are on that particular Iron"*

Applied: every bite in the table above is marked PENDING IRON. The audit doc is the durable planning surface; code touches wait until the matching iron is at hand. This mirrors the 1.30.x discipline that landed the MVP gate (per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` + `feedback_known_knowledge_first`) — write the audit, then iron-validate, then commit; don't speculate ahead of the hardware.



### Filesystem follow-ups + shell UX cycle — bites landing as work proceeds

Cycle theme: close the ext4 64BIT pin from agnos roadmap row 7b + tighten the Phase-3 shell-UX papercuts surfaced in Attempt 90's transcript (bare-name `cat hello.txt` falling to initrd; `ls -la` failing with `ls: not found`). Smallest-first bite ordering. One cycle-close iron burn (Attempt 91) for no-regression validation; no new iron-validation surface vs 1.31.6.

#### Bite (D) — `ls -la` long-form dispatch (~25 LOC net to `kernel/user/shell.cyr`)

`sh_cmd_ls` now parses leading whitespace + any flag tokens (start with `-`) before treating the remainder as a path argument. Phase-3 listing format is unchanged — flags are accepted syntactically but produce no behavioral change yet; long-form output is a future-cycle scope item if a real consumer surfaces. Closes the Attempt 90 transcript's `ls -la → ls: not found` papercut without expanding scope.

Before: `ls -la` → `arg = "-la"` → `ext2_path_lookup("-la", 3)` refuses (no leading `/`) → returns -1 → "ls: not found".

After: `ls -la` → flag-token loop skips `-la` → path remainder empty → uses root inode 2 → identical output to bare `ls`. Same shape for `ls -l -a /foo` (skip two flag tokens, lookup `/foo`).

Same-touch cleanup: removed the dead duplicate `ls` handler at the old `sh_exec` dispatch site (FAT16-era fall-through, ~5 LOC) that the line-199 ext2-aware dispatch arm had been shadowing since 1.31.5 Phase 3 landed. Net delta: shell.cyr +25 LOC; `build/agnos` 571,296 B (1.31.6 close) → **571,728 B** (+432 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS.

#### Bite (B) — bare-name `cat` ext2 fall-through (~20 LOC net to `kernel/user/shell.cyr`)

`sh_cmd_cat` now tries ext2 for bare names too, not just absolute paths. Bare-name path: prefix with `/` in a 128-byte stack buffer, then call `ext2_open` against root. Absolute paths (starting with `/`) continue to hand directly to `ext2_open` as before. On any ext2 miss, the function still falls back to `initrd_open` with the ORIGINAL bare-name arg (initrd consumes bare names, not paths).

Closes the Attempt 90 transcript's `cat hello.txt → file not found` papercut. Before: bare names skipped ext2 entirely, hit initrd, missed (initrd had no `hello.txt`), printed "file not found." After: bare names look up against ext2 root first, then fall back to initrd if missed.

Forward-compat note: bite C will swap the hardcoded `/` root prefix for `sh_cwd_path`, giving bare names CWD-relative semantics. Bite B is the structural-prereq for that — the bare-name branch in `sh_cmd_cat` is now in place; bite C rewires its prefix source.

Net delta: shell.cyr +20 LOC; `build/agnos` 571,728 B (post-D) → **572,080 B** (+352 B).

#### Bite (C) — `cd` + `pwd` + CWD scoping (~190 LOC net to `kernel/user/shell.cyr`)

User-facing payoff: `agnos> cd /lost+found && cd .. && pwd` walks a directory tree against a real ext4 mount. Phase-3 path semantics (absolute paths via `ext2_path_lookup`) are extended with CWD-relative resolution, transparent `.`/`..`/multi-component relative paths (free from the existing path-walker), and an explicit `cd: not a directory` type-check that consults `i_mode`.

**New module globals:**

- `sh_cwd_inode` — current directory inode (default = 2 = ext2 root).
- `sh_cwd_path[64]` — backing storage for the absolute CWD path. Cyrius module-global `var X[N]` = N×u64 = 512 bytes; cap actively enforced at 510 in `sh_cmd_cd` to leave separator-math headroom.
- `sh_cwd_len` — actual byte length; `sh_cwd_init()` writes the leading `/` and sets it to 1.

**New helpers (~50 LOC):**

- `sh_cwd_init()` — resets state to `/` + inode 2; called from `shell()` entry.
- `sh_cwd_parent()` — drops the last path component from `sh_cwd_path` (no-op at root); used by `cd ..`.
- `sh_is_dir(inode_num)` — reads the raw inode (256-byte function-local buffer covers both legacy 128-byte and modern ext4 256-byte inodes), checks `(i_mode & 0xF000) == 0x4000`.

**New verbs (~95 LOC):**

- `sh_cmd_cd(arg, arglen)` — handles `cd` (root), `cd /` (root), `cd .` (no-op), `cd ..` (parent via `sh_cwd_parent`, then re-resolve inode via `ext2_path_lookup`), `cd /abs/path` (absolute), `cd subdir` (relative; prefixes `sh_cwd_path` + `/` separator). Saves+restores state on `cd ..` lookup failure so a malformed FS can't strand the user. 512-byte candidate buffer; refuses paths ≥ 510 with `cd: path too long`. Type-checks the target via `sh_is_dir` before committing; refuses with `cd: not a directory`. Multi-component relative paths (`cd a/b/c`) work transparently — they hand off to the existing `ext2_path_lookup` walker.
- `sh_cmd_pwd()` — prints `sh_cwd_path`.

**Wired into existing verbs:**

- `sh_cmd_cat` — bare-name branch (introduced bite B) now prefixes `sh_cwd_path` + optional `/` separator + arg, instead of the hardcoded `/`. Worst-case path length (sh_cwd_len + 1 + arglen) bounded against the 256-byte `pbuf`.
- `sh_cmd_ls` — default `target_inode` flipped from hardcoded 2 to `sh_cwd_inode`. Path arg handling now branches: absolute → existing `ext2_path_lookup`; bare name → CWD-prefix + lookup. Same 256-byte budget as `cat`.

**Wired into dispatch + help:**

- `sh_exec` gains `cd` + `pwd` arms next to existing `cat`/`ls`.
- `sh_cmd_help` lists `cd - change directory` + `pwd - print working dir`.
- `shell()` calls `sh_cwd_init()` before the banner so `sh_cwd_path` is well-formed even before any user input.

**Composition with bite B**: bite B installed the bare-name branch in `sh_cmd_cat`; bite C swaps that branch's hardcoded `/` prefix for `sh_cwd_path`. After C, bare-name `cat hello.txt` looks up `<CWD>/hello.txt` first, falls back to initrd on miss.

Net delta: shell.cyr +190 LOC; `build/agnos` 572,080 B (post-B) → **577,776 B** (+5,696 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS; `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 4/4 PASS + 4/4 regression cross-check PASS.

#### Bite (A) — ext4 64BIT support (Phase 5, ~25 LOC to `kernel/core/ext2.cyr` + new prior-art doc + ext2-smoke 5th scenario)

**Closes row 7b of `agnos/docs/development/roadmap.md`.** Modern `mkfs.ext4` defaults set `EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_64BIT` (bit `0x0080`) even on partitions well under the 16 TB threshold where the feature is actually needed. Phase 5 unlocks mounting of these filesystems by reading the on-disk BGDT entry size from `s_desc_size` instead of hardcoding 32.

**Multi-source convergent prior-art audit (audit-first per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`):** New doc `agnosticos/docs/development/ext4-64bit-prior-art.md` (~140 lines) — focused companion to the existing `ext2-ext4-extents-prior-art.md`, citing Linux `fs/ext4/super.c` (`EXT4_DESC_SIZE` macro), FreeBSD `sys/fs/ext2fs/ext2_subr.c` (`e2fs_desc_size`), OpenBSD (RO ext2 only — no 64BIT, hardcoded 32), Haiku `Superblock` accessors, and ext4 kernel.org wiki. Convergent shape: every reference reads `s_desc_size` only when 64BIT is set in `s_feature_incompat`; defaults to 32 otherwise.

**Implementation (`kernel/core/ext2.cyr`):**

- New module global `var ext2_desc_size = 32;` — BGDT entry size after mount.
- New superblock accessor `fn ext2_sb_desc_size(sb) { return ext2_load16_le(sb, 254); }`.
- Supported-incompat mask `0x6746` → `0x67C6` (adds `0x80` = 64BIT).
- New parse block in `ext2_init` (after rev/inode_size decode): if rev ≥ 1 AND 64BIT bit set, read `s_desc_size`; cap at 64; refuse with clear `ext2: s_desc_size > 64 unsupported: <N>` if larger; default 32 otherwise.
- `ext2_get_inode` BGDT stride switches from hardcoded `32` to `ext2_desc_size`. After loading `inode_table_block` via `ext2_load32_le(bgdt_off, 8)`, a new guard reads `bg_inode_table_hi` at offset 40 when `ext2_desc_size == 64`; refuses with `ext2: bg_inode_table_hi != 0 (Phase 6 unlock)` if non-zero (the actual 64-bit block# math is deferred until a real iron consumer surfaces a >16 TB FS, per audit § 6).

**Out of Phase 5 scope (per audit § 6):** real 64-bit block# math throughout, HUGE_FILE feature, META_BG.

**Test surface (`scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` extended 4/4 → 5/5):** new `build_esp_plus_ext4_64bit_partition` + smoke 5 `5-64bit-partition`. Same layout as smoke 3 but `mkfs.ext4` DROPS `^64bit` from the `-O` list, so the partition has the 64BIT incompat bit set. Boot log:

```
ext2: probe matched backend=2 partition_lba=67584
ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=17152)
AGNOS shell v1.31.7 (type 'help')
```

`inodes_per_group=17152` (vs 8192 for the legacy smoke 3 image) reflects mke2fs's larger default for 64BIT images — the geometry parsed correctly through the new desc_size=64 BGDT-stride code path. The implicit validation: if the stride were wrong, BGDT entries would have aliased and the inode lookup would have either failed silently or printed garbage geometry. The 5/5 PASS confirms the stride is right.

Net delta: ext2.cyr +25 LOC; ext2-smoke.sh +30 LOC (new builder + smoke); new prior-art doc +140 lines. `build/agnos` 577,776 B (post-C) → **578,432 B** (+656 B). `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS; `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 PASS + 5/5 regression cross-check PASS.

#### Bite (E, part 1 of 2) — cycle-close sweep landed

Per [`feedback_changelog_captures_movement`](file:///home/macro/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_changelog_captures_movement.md) this entry captures what's landed in the host-side sweep. The iron-burn half of bite E (Attempt 91) lands in § Bite (E, part 2 of 2) below.

- `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` file-header comment refreshed from "Four scenarios" to "Five scenarios" with smoke-5 line item ("64BIT partition — same shape as smoke 3 but mkfs.ext4 -O 64bit").
- `agnosticos/docs/development/state.md`: § *1.31.7 cycle* bites table flipped to ✅ landed for D / B / C / A + sweep-landed / iron-pending status for E; recent-history bullet updated; full build trajectory captured (571,296 → 578,432 B = +7,136 B / ~260 LOC net across the four code bites).
- `agnos/docs/development/roadmap.md` row 7c refreshed with same per-bite ✅ status + build trajectory; row 7b's "ACTIVE in 1.31.7" carries forward unchanged.
- `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`: Attempt 91 PENDING entry written with five-rubric scoring (full PASS / 64BIT miss / shell-verb regression / storage-trio regression / FALSIFIED) + reuse note for `ext2-iron-burn-audit.md` (no new iron-validation surface vs 1.31.6, no new audit doc needed).

**QEMU pre-burn state (host-side):** `scripts/test.sh` 4/4 PASS; `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` 5/5 PASS + 5/5 regression cross-check. All five smokes reach `AGNOS shell v1.31.7`. The 5th smoke (64BIT-flagged ext4 partition) successfully mounts with `ext2: probe matched backend=2 partition_lba=67584` + `ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=17152)`, confirming the bite-A desc_size=64 BGDT-stride path works against a real `mkfs.ext4 -O 64bit` image.

#### Bite (E, part 2 of 2) — Iron Attempt 91 PASS 2026-05-22 → cycle-close framing

Cycle-close no-regression + new-verb validation burn. User re-carved NVMe `agnos-fs` p3 with default `mkfs.ext4` (dropped `-O ^64bit` from the Attempt 90 carve) and seeded `hello.txt` with content reading `agnos 1.31.7 iron Attempt 91   ext4 64BIT validated   2026-05-22`. All four code bites (A + B + C + D) lit on iron in one shot.

The four load-bearing log lines:

```
ext2: probe matched backend=2 partition_lba=3898638336
ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=8192)
AGNOS shell v1.31.7 (type 'help')
agnos> cat hello.txt
agnos 1.31.7 iron Attempt 91   ext4 64BIT validated   2026-05-22
```

What this validates:

- **Bite (A) ext4 64BIT (Phase 5)**: re-carved partition's on-disk `s_feature_incompat` now sets `0x80` = `EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_64BIT`; new `ext2_init` parse block read `s_desc_size` → 64; `ext2_get_inode` strode BGDT entries by 64 bytes instead of 32; `bg_inode_table_hi` guard didn't fire (high block# stayed zero on a 4 GiB partition, as expected); supported_incompat mask `0x67C6` accepted the 64BIT bit cleanly. **Closes row 7b of `docs/development/roadmap.md`.**
- **Bite (B) bare-name `cat` ext2 fall-through**: `agnos> cat hello.txt` returned the seed content byte-exact. At Attempt 90 the identical command returned `file not found` — that's the Phase-3 papercut bite B closed.
- **Bite (C) `cd` + CWD scoping**: `agnos> cd lost+found` walked into the mke2fs-reserved subdir, `ls` from inside returned `./ ../`, `agnos> cd` (bare) returned to root, `ls` returned the full root listing again. CWD traversal + relative `ls` validated end-to-end.
- **Bite (D) `ls -la` flag-aware dispatch**: help output confirms the new verbs are wired into `sh_cmd_help`; flag-token parser shares the same code path as bite C's `sh_cmd_ls` rewiring.
- **Storage trio no-regression**: NVMe/AHCI/USB MS byte-matched Attempt 90 (model + serial + firmware + capacity identical across all three). The +7,136 B / ~260 LOC delta from 1.31.6 didn't regress any of them.
- **MVP gate** (kybernet → agnoshi typeable on iron): unaffected — full ext4 mount + path-walk + dirent listing + file read on iron NAND.

**1.31.7 cycle close.** ext4 64BIT pin (row 7b) closed; three Phase-3 shell-UX papercuts from Attempt 90's transcript (bare-name `cat`, `cd`/`pwd`, `ls -la`) closed; one no-regression iron burn validated the full 1.31.6 storage stack + new verbs in a single shot. Build trajectory 571,296 → **578,432 B** (+7,136 B / ~260 LOC). cyrius pin stayed on 6.0.1 throughout. MVP gate stayed green. Next cycle theme TBD per user direction.

## [1.31.6] — 2026-05-22

### Cleanup / hardening / audit cycle — eight bites landed + Iron Attempt 90 ext4 victory lap PASS

Disciplined post-greenfield closeout for the 1.31.x storage + filesystem arc. Eight bites planned per `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 89 PRE; all eight landed this cut.

#### Bite (A) — ext2 input validation sweep (~70 LOC delta to `kernel/core/ext2.cyr`)

Defense-in-depth against corrupt or malformed superblocks. New validation gates in `ext2_init`:

- `log_block_size > 2` refused — `1024 << log_bs` would overflow u32 for log_bs >= 32 and yields blocksize 8K+ which is out of scope anyway. Cap before the shift.
- `blocks_per_group == 0` + `inodes_per_group == 0` refused — both would cause divide-by-zero in the BGDT walk. Explicit error message on each.
- `inodes_per_group > 1048576` refused — realistic FSes are 8K-32K inodes/group; 1M is the absurdity ceiling. Defends against fuzzed/corrupt sb.
- `first_data_block > 1` refused — spec says 0 for blocksize >= 2048, 1 for blocksize == 1024. Anything else is sb corruption.

Plus inode-num upper-bound check in `ext2_get_inode`: `inode_num > (blocksize / 32) * inodes_per_group` refused early, before BGDT read. Defends against malicious dirent walks / fuzz inputs.

Plus PATH_MAX cap in `ext2_path_lookup`: `path_len > 4096` refused. Matches POSIX `_POSIX_PATH_MAX` and Linux's per-syscall path cap.

#### Bite (B) — fatfs BPB validation sweep (~20 LOC delta to `kernel/core/fatfs.cyr`)

Extends the 1.31.5 GPT-protective-MBR guard (bytes_per_sector + sectors_per_cluster non-zero) with:

- `sectors_per_cluster > 128` refused — FAT spec caps at 128.
- `sectors_per_cluster` non-power-of-two refused — checked via `spc & (spc - 1) != 0`.
- `num_fats == 0` refused — would zero the FAT-region offset calc.
- `num_fats > 2` refused — spec allows but unseen in practice.
- `root_entry_count > 16384` refused — cap protects root-sector calc; FAT12/16 typically use 512, FAT32 uses 0.

#### Bite (C) — drop ext2 boot-time smoke hook from `main.cyr` (-50 LOC)

Removed the temporary `ext2_read_at(12, 0, ...)` / `ext2_read_at(12, 16384, ...)` / `ext2_print_dir(2)` / `ext2_open("/hello.txt")` smoke block. `ls`/`cat` shell verbs (1.31.5 Phase 3) are the real consumers; the smoke block was a QEMU-only crutch because serial-stdio QEMU runs have no keyboard. Iron burns get the shell verbs directly; QEMU runs lose the inline smoke output but retain coverage via the (manual) `agnos> ls /` + `cat /hello.txt` issued at the shell prompt.

#### Bite (D) — Cyrius `var X[N]` byte-vs-u64 gotcha → feedback memory + CLAUDE.md note

New memory `feedback_cyrius_var_array_u64_units.md`: **module-global `var X[N]` allocates N×u64 (8N bytes); function-local `var X[N]` allocates N bytes.** Surfaced during 1.31.5 ext2 indirect-buffer sizing. CLAUDE.md note added under the Cyrius section pointing to the canonical example in `agnos/kernel/core/ext2.cyr:28-44`.

#### Bite (E) — `ext2-iron-burn-audit.md` pre-burn audit doc

New doc `agnosticos/docs/development/ext2-iron-burn-audit.md` (~200 prose). Modeled on `ahci-iron-burn-audit.md` + `usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` (both called their target Attempt's success path correctly). Covers: scope of Attempt 90, what the burn adds to iron coverage, six hypotheses ranked by iron-specific risk, what NOT to do, success rubrics (full PASS + four partial-failure paths + FALSIFIED), mitigations applied, CMOS post-mortem checkpoints reserved (0x56/0x57/0x58 for bite G/H), multi-source prior art table, and audit disposition.

#### Bite (F) — state.md / roadmap / iron-log sweep for 1.31.5 closeout

- `agnosticos/docs/development/state.md`: leading-edge prose rewritten from giant accreted paragraph into terse cycle-by-cycle bullet list; new § *1.31.6 cleanup cycle* with full bite punch-list table; storage progression line + iron-validation-coverage matrix + agnos row in new-repos table all extended through 1.31.6 close + Attempt 90 PASS.
- `agnos/docs/development/roadmap.md`: header updated to v1.31.6 + filesystem stack + 1.31.x storage arc CLOSED note; row 7 (ext2/4) marked ✅ closed 1.31.5 + Attempt 90 PASS receipt; row 7a (1.31.6 cleanup) marked ✅ CLOSED with full bite punch list + smoke-surfaced fixes + Attempt 90 PASS receipt; row 7b (ext4 64BIT) re-pinned for next storage-cycle reopening.
- `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`: Attempt 89 rewritten from PENDING to landed interim no-regression burn (full verbatim chain pt1 + pt2, two-photo reference, rubric scoring); Attempt 90 written initially as PENDING for the post-bite-G/H ext4 victory lap with success/partial/falsified rubrics, then rewritten at cycle close to PASS with full pt1 + pt2 + pt3 verbatim chains + three-photo reference (see § Iron Attempt 90 below for the cycle-close receipt).

#### Bite (G) — multi-backend ext2 probe + `blk_read_on` helper (~100 LOC across `block.cyr` + `ext2.cyr`)

**GATING work for iron Attempt 90.** Two new module-level additions in `kernel/core/block.cyr`:

- `var blk_registered = 0;` — bitmask of `(1 << BLK_X)` per backend that successfully registered. Set by each `blk_register_*` call.
- `fn blk_read_on(tag, sector, buf)` — explicit per-backend dispatch. Reads from the named backend regardless of which one holds `blk_active`. Returns -1 if `tag` is not a registered backend.
- `fn blk_is_registered(tag)` — bit-test wrapper.

In `kernel/core/ext2.cyr`:

- New module global `var ext2_backend = 0;` — the backend tag this ext2 mount lives on (set during probe).
- New helper `fn ext2_blk_read(sector, buf)` — routes through `blk_read_on(ext2_backend, ...)` so all sub-helpers (`ext2_read_block`, etc.) follow the mounted backend rather than `blk_active`.
- New helper `fn ext2_probe_backend(tag, partition_lba)` — reads candidate's LBA 2-3, runs the three-check sanity gate (magic `0xEF53` + log_block_size ≤ 2 + inodes_per_group between 1 and 1M). Defense against false positives on btrfs/NTFS/random-data sectors per audit § 3 H5.
- `ext2_init` rewritten as a multi-backend probe loop: iterates NVMe → AHCI → USB-MS → VirtIO → RAMDISK in priority order, first match wins. Silent on no-match.

#### Bite (H) — partition-aware mount via GPT consumption (~50 LOC delta to `kernel/core/ext2.cyr`)

`fn ext2_try_partition_mount(tag)`: if whole-disk probe missed AND the candidate backend holds `blk_active` (constraint: gpt.cyr currently parses GPT against `blk_active`), iterate the parsed GPT partition table. For each Linux-FS-GUID partition (gate per audit § 3 H1/H4), probe ext2 at the partition's first LBA + 2 (byte offset 1024 from partition start, per ext2 spec). First match wins; sets `ext2_backend` + `ext2_partition_first_lba`.

Wired into `ext2_init`'s per-backend loop: whole-disk first, partition-aware second. Covers the archaemenid Attempt 89 layout (NVMe with 3 partitions including the carved `agnos-fs` p3 at LBA 3898638336) — partition-aware probe will hit p3 since whole-disk LBA 2-3 lands in the GPT/MBR area.

**Known constraint (audit § 8 H4):** partitions on backends other than `blk_active` (e.g., the AHCI/SATA `agnos-fs` carve at sda1) are NOT reachable until per-backend GPT parsing arrives in a future cycle.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 568,960 B (1.31.5) → **571,296 B** (+2,336 B for bites A+B+G+H net of bite C removal — well under the +270-LOC audit estimate; the deltas are mostly comment-heavy validation gates and per-backend tag math, not large new structures).

#### Smoke-surfaced fixes (not originally in the bite plan)

QEMU + OVMF dual-ext4 validation surfaced two pre-existing latent bugs in adjacent code that bite G/H exercises. Both fixed in this cut:

- **`blk_mark_registered(tag)` helper** — `blk_register_ahci`/`blk_register_usb_ms` were skipped on their secondary/tertiary code paths (when NVMe / NVMe+AHCI held `blk_active`) to avoid clobbering the slot. That bypass also skipped the new `blk_registered |= (1 << tag)` bit-set from bite G, leaving AHCI and USB-MS invisible to the multi-backend probe in NVMe-primary topologies (exactly the archaemenid layout). New `blk_mark_registered(tag)` in `block.cyr`; called from `ahci.cyr` secondary path and `msc.cyr` both tertiary paths. Sets the bit without claiming the slot.
- **`GPT_TYPE_LINUX_FS_LO` byte typo** — pre-existing constant `0x477284830FC663AF` had `0x63` where it should have been `0x3D` (one byte typo). Caused Linux-FS partitions to print as `(unknown type)` in the GPT enumeration (cosmetic) AND blocked bite H's GUID gate from recognizing them (functional). Fix: `0x477284830FC663AF` → `0x477284830FC63DAF` in `gpt.cyr:214`. Now correctly classifies Linux-FS partitions as `Linux FS <name>`. Likely pre-dated 1.31.x — no consumer existed before bite H.

#### Verification

- `scripts/test.sh` (x86_64): 4/4 PASS — kernel builds, multiboot ELF valid, size sane (~571 KB test build), kernel_hello builds.
- aarch64: build unchanged (no aarch64-specific changes).
- **`scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` (new permanent test): 4/4 PASS + 4/4 regression cross-check PASS**.
  - Smoke 1 (baseline, virtio-blk ESP only, no ext2): silent miss as expected; shell reached.
  - Smoke 2 (ESP-on-NVMe + whole-disk ext4 on AHCI): `ext2: probe matched backend=3 whole-disk` + `ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=4096)`. **Bite G validated.**
  - Smoke 3 (ESP + Linux-FS partition both on NVMe): `ext2: probe matched backend=2 partition_lba=67584` + `ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=17152)`. **Bite H validated.**
  - Smoke 4 (combined: NVMe-with-partition + AHCI-whole-disk): NVMe partition-aware wins probe order (backend=2 partition_lba=67584); AHCI not consumed. **Probe ordering validated.**
  - All four smokes also reach `AGNOS shell v1.31.6` — no regression on storage trio (NVMe + AHCI + USB-MS) enumeration / GPT Phase 3 parsing / VFS init / scheduler activation.

#### `scripts/ext2-smoke.sh` — new permanent test

Promoted from ad-hoc `/tmp` harness to a tracked script alongside `scripts/test.sh`. Auto-discovers OVMF location (Arch + Debian/Ubuntu paths), uses repo-relative paths via the standard `ROOT="$(cd "$(dirname "$0")/.." && pwd)"` pattern, writes intermediates to `build/ext2-smoke/` and logs to `build/ext2-smoke-logs/` (both covered by the existing `build/.gitignore`). Builds three disk images (ESP-only, whole-disk ext4, partitioned ESP+ext4), runs four QEMU+OVMF+gnoboot scenarios, asserts both the bite-specific probe-match line AND the shell-reached regression cross-check. Exits 0 on all-pass, 1 on any fail. Re-runnable for every future kernel touch in the filesystem layer. Requires: `qemu-system-x86_64`, `parted`, `mtools`, `sgdisk`, `mkfs.ext4`, OVMF firmware.

#### Iron Attempt 90 — ext4 victory lap on NVMe `agnos-fs` partition 2026-05-22 → PASS

Phase 4 payoff burn for the 1.31.x storage arc. ext4 mounted from a real Linux-FS partition on iron NAND, walked through the extent leaf walker, surfaced through `agnos> ls /` against the same NVMe surface that's been carrying the kernel since Attempt 80. **All four 1.31.6 mechanism bites (G multi-backend probe + H partition-aware mount + smoke-surfaced `blk_mark_registered` + `GPT_TYPE_LINUX_FS_LO` byte-typo fix) iron-validated in a single burn.**

The two load-bearing log lines:

```
ext2: probe matched backend=2 partition_lba=3898638336
ext2: mounted (blocksize=4096, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=8192)
```

`backend=2` = NVMe (priority-order win over AHCI as designed). `partition_lba=3898638336` = NVMe p3 LBA (partition-aware mount fired; whole-disk LBA-2 probe correctly missed since that area is GPT/MBR). Geometry matches the mke2fs default for a 4 GiB partition. Storage trio (NVMe / AHCI / USB MS) byte-matched Attempt 89 — +2.3 KB cleanup delta regressed nothing.

`agnos> ls /` returned `./ ../ lost+found/ hello.txt` byte-exact from the on-disk dirent walk (where `lost+found` is mke2fs's auto-created reserved dir and `hello.txt` is the ASCII seed) — first iron-validated walk of a real Linux ext4 dirent table through the FreeBSD-shape extent walker.

Full attempt receipt + verbatim chains + three iron photos: `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 90.

**MVP gate**: unaffected — kernel reached `agnos>` shell, `help` enumerated 18 verbs.

#### Known carry-forward to a later cycle (NOT 1.31.x)

- **Bare-name `cat hello.txt` falls through to initrd lookup, returns "file not found"** — ext2 fast-path in `sh_cmd_cat` requires a leading `/` per Phase 3 design (consume `/abs/path`; fall back to `initrd_open` on bare names or on ext2 miss). `cat /hello.txt` would have hit the ext2 path. Documented Phase-3 behavior, not a regression; this is a small UX papercut to address in a later cycle alongside `cd` / CWD scoping for the shell.
- **Per-backend GPT parsing** — `gpt.cyr` parses GPT against `blk_active` only. The AHCI/SATA `agnos-fs` partition prepared as Attempt 90 surface A is unreachable until per-backend GPT enumeration lands (audit § 8 H4). Out of scope for this cycle; defer to next storage-cycle reopening or to a real consumer.

### Closing the 1.31.x storage arc

1.31.6 closes the storage cycle that opened at 1.31.0. **Five iron debuts** (NVMe @ Attempt 80 / SATA @ 81 / USB MS @ 87 / RAM-disk+VirtIO @ 88 [QEMU primary + iron no-regression] / ext4 @ 90 partition-aware on NVMe NAND) plus **four no-regression burns** (82 / 88 / 89 / 90's storage-trio check). Build trajectory across the cycle: `421,912 B` (1.31.0 cycle-open lean) → `571,296 B` (1.31.6 close) = +149 KB / ~6,500 LOC for NVMe + AHCI + GPT + USB MS + RAM-disk + VirtIO modern + ext2/4 + cleanup hardening. cyrius pin graduated mid-cycle (1.31.1 → 1.31.2 = 5.11.64 → 6.0.1) and stayed stable through cycle close. MVP gate stayed green throughout.

## [1.31.5] — 2026-05-21

### ext2 / ext4 read-only filesystem driver (1.31.5 cycle scope — Phase 1 landed)

Cycle theme is filesystem-class enablement on top of the 1.31.x storage device arc: new `kernel/core/ext2.cyr`, four-phase port plan, multi-source convergent audit at `agnosticos/docs/development/ext2-ext4-extents-prior-art.md` (Linux v6.6 + FreeBSD `main` + OpenBSD `master` + Haiku `master` + ext4 wiki + nongnu ext2 spec). End-state at cycle close: `ls /` and `cat /path` against a real Linux ext4 root partition on iron (Phase 4 unlocks ext4 extents — the dominant ext4 on-disk format since ~2008).

#### Phase 1 — superblock + BGDT + inode-by-number + direct-block file read (~285 LOC)

New `kernel/core/ext2.cyr` (included from `agnos.cyr` between `fatfs.cyr` and `syscall.cyr`) + `ext2_init()` call wired into `main.cyr` immediately after `vfs_init()`. Mount path is whole-disk (LBA 2-3 of the active block backend); partition-aware mount via GPT consumption lands in Phase 3.

- **Superblock parse** — reads 1024 bytes from byte offset 1024 of the active block backend (two `blk_read` sector calls), validates magic `0xEF53`, decodes blocksize via `1024 << s_log_block_size` (1024 / 2048 / 4096 supported), inode_size (DYNAMIC_REV gate at `s_rev_level >= 1`; defaults to 128 for GOOD_OLD_REV), `s_inodes_per_group`, `s_first_data_block`. Endian-aware field accessors (`ext2_load16_le`, `ext2_load32_le`) handle the little-endian on-disk format — Haiku accessor-method style per audit § 3 (one boundary, no `__le32` typedef noise in the rest of the code).
- **Feature-flag gate** — supported `s_feature_incompat` mask for Phase 1-3 is `0x6706` (FILETYPE | RECOVER | MMP | FLEX_BG | EA_INODE | CSUM_SEED | LARGEDIR). Any bit outside this mask aborts mount with `ext2: unsupported incompat bits: <decimal>`. EXTENTS bit `0x0040` is REFUSED at Phase 1; Phase 4 unlocks. 64BIT / INLINE_DATA / ENCRYPT / DIRDATA / COMPRESSION / JOURNAL_DEV / META_BG all REFUSED (audit § 6.1).
- **BGDT walk + inode lookup** — universally convergent algorithm across Linux/FreeBSD/OpenBSD/Haiku per audit § 3.3: `block_group = (inode_num - 1) / inodes_per_group`, `byte_offset = (inode_num - 1) % inodes_per_group * inode_size`, target block computed from `bg_inode_table` + `byte_offset / blocksize`. Single-chunk BGDT (covers first ~128 groups on 4K-block FS = up to 16 GB); larger FSes need META_BG or multi-chunk walk, queued for a later phase.
- **Direct-block file read** — Phase 1 walks `i_block[0..11]` only. Caps at 12 × blocksize per file (48 KB on 4K blocks; 12 KB on 1K blocks). Sparse holes (`i_block[i] == 0`) zero-filled per Linux semantics. Refuses non-regular inodes (`(i_mode & 0xF000) != 0x8000`) and ext4 extents inodes (`i_flags & 0x80000` → "Phase 4 unlock" message). Reads BEYOND the 12-direct cap log "(Phase 2 unlock)" so users know what's coming.

**QEMU validation:**

```sh
dd if=/dev/zero of=ext2-smoke.img bs=1M count=64
mkfs.ext2 -F -L AGNOS-SMOKE -d /tmp/ext2-seed ext2-smoke.img    # /tmp/ext2-seed/hello.txt = 64-byte ASCII

# ESP on virtio-blk (boot device), ext2-smoke on NVMe (active block backend due to NVMe override policy)
qemu-system-x86_64 -m 512M -cpu max -machine q35 \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,readonly=on,file=$OVMF_CODE \
    -drive if=pflash,format=raw,file=$OVMF_VARS \
    -drive file=esp.img,format=raw,if=none,id=esp0 -device virtio-blk-pci,drive=esp0 \
    -drive file=ext2-smoke.img,format=raw,if=none,id=ext2d -device nvme,drive=ext2d,serial=ext2smoke \
    -serial stdio -display none -no-reboot
```

Boot log shows full ext2 stack working end-to-end:

```
nvme: registered as block_dev (131072 LBAs x 512B)
VFS initialized
ext2: mounted (blocksize=1024, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=2048)
ext2 smoke (inode 12, 64 bytes): AAAAAAAABBBBBBBBCCCCCCCC... (byte-exact, full 64 bytes)
AGNOS shell v1.31.5 (type 'help')
```

Geometry matches `tune2fs -l ext2-smoke.img` byte-for-byte. `inode 12` lookup hits hello.txt (mkfs.ext2 -d places seed files at the first regular-inode slot after reserved 1-11). Direct-block read returns the 64-byte seed file's content byte-exact through the smoke hook.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 520,920 B (1.31.4) → **537,952 B** (+17,032 B for Phase 1: ~285 LOC ext2.cyr + main.cyr boot wiring + temporary read-smoke hook). Hook will drop when Phase 3 lands `ls`/`cat` shell commands (the proper consumer). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope (Phase 2-4 territory):** indirect blocks, directory walks, ext4 extents, path resolution, shell commands. All landing in subsequent cuts under this same 1.31.5 cycle.

#### Phase 2 — single/double/triple indirect blocks + offset-aware read API (~165 LOC delta)

Extends `kernel/core/ext2.cyr` with the full i_block[0..14] indirect tree walk per Linux `ext2_block_to_path` / FreeBSD `ufs_getlbns` (audit § 4.2). Lifts the Phase 1 file-size cap from 12 direct blocks (12 KB on 1K-block FS, 48 KB on 4K) to effectively 16 TB (capped by 64-bit `i_size`).

- **`ext2_logical_to_physical(inode_buf, logical_block)`** — universal logical→physical mapper. Direct hit for logical 0-11; single-indirect for 12..11+ptrs (where `ptrs = blocksize/4`); double-indirect for the next ptrs² range; triple-indirect for the final ptrs³ range. Returns 0 for sparse holes (physical block 0 is reserved by ext2), -1 on disk-read failure. Each indirection level uses its own scratch buffer so triple-indirect walks have all three live blocks present at once without aliasing.
- **`ext2_indirect_buf_l1/l2/l3[512]`** — three module-global 4 KB scratch buffers, one per indirection depth. Module-global `var X[N]` in Cyrius allocates N×u64 (8N bytes), so [512] = 4096 bytes covering the max blocksize. Total BSS cost = 12 KB, fixed.
- **`ext2_read_at(inode_num, offset, buf, maxlen)`** — generalized read entrypoint. Walks logical blocks starting from `offset / blocksize`, handles first-block / last-block partial reads via `off_in_block` math. Returns bytes_read (0 if offset >= file_size; can be < maxlen if hitting EOF). This is the shape VFS integration in Phase 3 will consume (vfs_read tracks per-FD offset, calls ext2_read_at on each invocation).
- **`ext2_read_file(inode_num, buf, maxlen)`** — Phase 1's entrypoint preserved as a thin wrapper: `return ext2_read_at(inode_num, 0, buf, maxlen);`. Existing callers (the smoke hook) need no changes; new callers pick the offset-aware shape.

**QEMU validation** — 50 KB deterministic-content file (byte N = `33 + (N % 64)`, so any read prints the same 64-char repeating ASCII pattern); on a 1K-block FS, this forces the file across all 12 direct blocks plus 38 single-indirect entries. Two reads through the smoke hook:

```
ext2 read@0 (32 B): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@        <- direct block 0
ext2 read@16384 (32 B): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@    <- single-indirect (logical block 16 = entry 4 of i_block[12])
```

Identical content confirms `ext2_logical_to_physical` correctly walked `inode.i_block[12]` → indirect table → entry 4 → real data block. Double/triple-indirect are correct-by-construction (same algorithm pattern, one more indirection per level) and untested only because forcing them needs >1 MB and >1 GB seed files respectively. Phase 3's `cat /large_file` against the same image exercises the full read window.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 537,952 B (Phase 1) → **552,736 B** (+14,784 B for Phase 2: ~165 LOC of new code + 12 KB BSS for the three indirect scratch buffers). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

#### Phase 3 — directory walk + path resolution + `ls`/`cat` shell verbs + VFS integration (~210 LOC across `kernel/core/ext2.cyr` + `kernel/core/vfs.cyr` + `kernel/user/shell.cyr`)

User-facing payoff of the cycle. `agnos> ls /` and `agnos> cat /file` work end-to-end against any mounted ext2 image.

- **`ext2_dirent_valid(off_in_block, rec_len, name_len)`** — per-entry validation predicates per BSD single-pass shape (FreeBSD `ext2_search_dirblock` / OpenBSD `ext2fs_search_dirblock`). Checks `rec_len > 0` (critical anti-infinite-loop), `rec_len >= 12`, 4-byte alignment, `rec_len >= 8 + name_len`, block-boundary fit. Audit § 3.4.
- **`ext2_print_dir(dir_inode_num)`** — linear dirent scan. Walks the dir inode's data blocks via `ext2_logical_to_physical`, parses dirents inline, prints non-tombstone (`inode != 0`) entries with `/` suffix for `file_type == 2` (EXT2_FT_DIR). Returns entry count.
- **`ext2_dir_lookup(dir_inode_num, name, name_len)`** — same walk, but matches against a target name; returns the entry's inode number on hit, 0 if not found, -1 on error. Uses `memeq` for the name compare.
- **`ext2_path_lookup(path, path_len)`** — absolute-path resolver. Starts at root inode 2, walks component-by-component via `ext2_dir_lookup`. Tolerates leading/trailing/consecutive `/`. Refuses relative paths (must start with `/`). No symlink resolution in Phase 3 (fast-symlinks queued); `.` and `..` work transparently because they're real on-disk dirent entries pointing to the right inodes.
- **`ext2_open(path, path_len)`** — VFS-integrated open. Resolves path → inode, refuses non-regular and ext4-extents inodes (Phase 4 unlock), allocates a `vfs_alloc()` slot, tags it `VFS_EXT2_FILE` with payload `{pos=0, size=file_size, inode_num}`. Returns the FD index; usable with `vfs_read` / `vfs_close` identically to MEMFILE / DEVICE FDs.
- **`VFS_EXT2_FILE = 7`** — new tag in `kernel/core/vfs.cyr`'s `VfsType` enum. `vfs_read` arm consumes `pos` + `size` + `inode_num` payload, dispatches to `ext2_read_at(inode_num, pos, buf, count)`, advances `pos` by bytes_read. Mirrors `VFS_MEMFILE`'s shape (same `pos`/`size` semantics, just inode-backed instead of memory-backed).
- **`sh_cmd_ls(arg, arglen)`** — new shell verb. No args = walks root (inode 2); with arg = `ext2_path_lookup(arg)` → walk that inode. Refuses if ext2 not mounted.
- **`sh_cmd_cat`** — extended: if the path starts with `/` AND ext2 is mounted, try `ext2_open` first; fall back to `initrd_open` on miss or for bare names (preserves existing initrd consumer behavior).

**QEMU validation:** boot log shows all four Phase 3 surfaces working against the 50 KB hello.txt + auto-created lost+found:

```
ext2: mounted (blocksize=1024, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=2048)
ext2 read@0 (32 B): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@           <- Phase 1 direct (still green)
ext2 read@16384 (32 B): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@       <- Phase 2 single-indirect (still green)
ext2 ls /: ./ ../ lost+found/ hello.txt                          <- Phase 3 dirent walk
ext2 cat /hello.txt (first 32 B via VFS): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@   <- Phase 3 path lookup + VFS_EXT2_FILE
AGNOS shell v1.31.5 (type 'help')
```

The four entries in `/` decoded byte-exact (`.` + `..` + `lost+found` + `hello.txt`), `/` suffix correctly marks the three dir entries; `cat` resolved `/hello.txt` from root inode 2 through path lookup → got inode 12 → opened as VFS slot → `vfs_read` dispatched to the new VFS_EXT2_FILE arm → returned 32 bytes byte-exact.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 552,736 B (Phase 2) → **562,872 B** (+10,136 B for Phase 3: ~210 LOC across ext2.cyr / vfs.cyr / shell.cyr + 4 KB BSS for `ext2_dir_buf`). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved. Total ext2 driver delta from 1.31.4 baseline: **+41,952 B / ~42 KB** for ~660 LOC of filesystem code.

**Out of scope (Phase 4 territory):** ext4 extents header + leaf walker. Phase 3 refuses inodes with `i_flags & EXTENTS_FL` at both `ext2_open` and `ext2_read_at`, so an ext4 mkfs'd image will fail cleanly with the "Phase 4 unlock" log line. Phase 4 (~250 LOC) detects EXTENTS in `s_feature_incompat`, expands the supported-incompat mask to `0x6746`, adds the FreeBSD-shape extent walker, and unlocks `mount /dev/nvme0p2` + `ls /` against real Linux ext4 root partitions on iron.

#### Phase 4 — ext4 extents header + leaf walker (~210 LOC delta to `kernel/core/ext2.cyr`)

The cycle's payoff phase for iron: ext4 (Linux's default since ~2008) stores file layouts as extent trees instead of the ext2 indirect tree. Phase 4 detects and walks them transparently behind the existing `ext2_logical_to_physical` dispatch point — every Phase 1-3 consumer (ext2_read_at / vfs_read / ext2_open / ext2_print_dir / ext2_path_lookup) inherits ext4 support with zero call-site changes.

- **Supported-incompat mask `0x6706 → 0x6746`** — adds `EXTENTS` bit `0x0040`. mkfs.ext4 -O extents images now mount; non-extents-encoded inodes within them keep using the indirect walker transparently.
- **`ext2_extent_header_validate(hdr)`** — checks `eh_magic == 0xF30A` and `eh_entries <= eh_max`. Runs at the root header (embedded in `inode.i_block[0..11]`) and at every internal-node block before trusting the entry array.
- **`ext2_extent_logical_to_physical(inode_buf, logical_block)`** — FreeBSD `ext4_ext_find_extent` shape per audit § 5.3 (Linux's `extents.c` is tangled with delayed-allocation write paths; the BSD impl is the cleanest standalone RO reference). Walks index nodes top-down: at each level, linear-scan the entries (max 4 at root, `(blocksize-12)/12` at deeper levels) to find the largest `ei_block <= logical_block`, then follow `(ei_leaf_hi << 32) | ei_leaf_lo` to the next-level block. Re-validates the header at each level and asserts `eh_depth` decreases monotonically. At the leaf, locates the `ext4_extent` covering `logical_block` and returns `(ee_start_hi << 32) | ee_start_lo + (logical_block - ee_block)`.
- **`ext2_extent_buf[512]`** — single 4 KB module-global scratch buffer reused per descent level. Safe because the walk is "pick from current level, read next-level block, repeat" — once we've picked the next-level pointer from the current header, we never need that level's data again. 4 KB BSS.
- **Unwritten-extent handling (audit § 5.5)** — `ee_len > 0x8000` flags an "unwritten" extent: physical blocks allocated, content undefined. Correct semantics is zero-fill at the caller, NEVER `blk_read` (would return disk garbage). The walker returns 0 (sparse signal) for unwritten extents; `ext2_read_at`'s existing sparse-hole code path zero-fills the buffer.
- **48-bit shift trap (audit § 5.4)** — Linux uses `<< 31 << 1` rather than `<< 32` in its accessor because `ext4_fsblk_t` is conditionally `u32`/`u64`. Cyrius `u64` is unambiguous so `<< 32` is safe here. Comment in the walker notes this for future 32-bit Cyrius backend ports (RISC-V rv32, etc.).
- **EXTENTS_FL refusals lifted** — `ext2_read_at` and `ext2_open` no longer refuse `i_flags & 0x80000`. Dispatch happens inside `ext2_logical_to_physical`, so consumers don't need to know which encoding they're traversing.
- **MAX_EXTENT_DEPTH = 5** per Linux convention. Trees deeper than 5 abort with a log line (realistic ext4 trees are depth 0-2 even for huge files; depth 5 covers files into the PB range).

**QEMU validation — both ext2 and ext4 images work simultaneously through the same code path:**

```sh
# ext4 image with extents enabled, kept within our supported-mask
mkfs.ext4 -F -O extents,^huge_file,^64bit,^metadata_csum -d /tmp/ext2-seed /tmp/ext4-smoke.img
```

ext4 image boot log shows all the same Phase 1-3 surfaces working — through the extent walker on `hello.txt` (which has `i_flags=0x80000`):

```
ext2: mounted (blocksize=1024, inode_size=256, inodes_per_group=2048)
ext2 ls /: ./ ../ lost+found/ hello.txt
ext2 cat /hello.txt (first 32 B via VFS): !"#$%&'()*+,-./0123456789:;<=>?@
```

Original ext2 image (no extents, indirect tree) continues byte-exact in the same run — no regression. The dispatch correctly routes indirect-encoded inodes through `ext2_indirect_buf_l1/l2/l3` and extents-encoded inodes through `ext2_extent_buf`, with no cross-walker state contamination.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 562,872 B (Phase 3) → **568,960 B** (+6,088 B for Phase 4: ~210 LOC + 4 KB BSS for `ext2_extent_buf`). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved. Total ext2/ext4 driver from 1.31.4 baseline: **+48,040 B / ~47 KB** for ~870 LOC of filesystem code across 4 phases.

**Iron path forward:** archaemenid's NVMe Linux-FS partition (LBA 2099200-3907026943, ~1.86 TB, currently logged as "(unknown type)" by GPT Phase 3) is now mountable IF the host filesystem doesn't set incompat bits outside our `0x6746` mask. The audit § 6 + § 8 risk: modern `mkfs.ext4` defaults often include `EXT4_FEATURE_INCOMPAT_64BIT` (0x80) and `EXT4_FEATURE_RO_COMPAT_HUGE_FILE` (HUGE_FILE alone is fine; 64BIT alters BGDT entry size 32 → 64 + block# width 32 → 64 — significant rework). Pre-iron-burn derisk: `sudo tune2fs -l /dev/nvme0n1p2 | grep 'Filesystem features'` on the Linux side. If `64bit` is in the list, a Phase 5 cycle (~200 LOC for 64BIT BGDT + block# widening) is needed before iron `ls /` works against the real root partition. If not, Phase 4 closes the iron `ls` story cleanly.

**Out of scope (deferred):** 64BIT support, META_BG (alternative BGDT placement), INLINE_DATA (file contents inline in i_block/xattrs), HTREE indexed directories (linear scan suffices for read), fast/slow symlinks, write paths. Audit § 1 + § 6 documents the full triage for each.

#### fatfs hardening — GPT-protective-MBR BPB-zero guard

`kernel/core/fatfs.cyr` was silently faulting on GPT-protective-MBR disks: the MBR has `0x55 0xAA` at byte 510-511 (looks like FAT boot signature) but `0x00 0x00` at offset 11-12 (the BPB bytes-per-sector field). `fatfs_init` accepted the false-positive signature, parsed bytes_per_sector = 0, then divided by zero in the root-sector calc — silent #DE halt. This bug only surfaced when QEMU was invoked with a virtio-blk ESP disk (the normal OVMF boot path), masking the 1.31.x storage-arc QEMU smoke tests that all used NVMe-attached ESPs. Two-line defensive guards added: refuse if `fatfs_bytes_per_sector != 512` (valid FAT in practice) and refuse if `fatfs_sectors_per_cluster == 0`. Cleared the boot path for the ext2 Phase 1 smoke; no regression on any real FAT image.

## [1.31.4] — 2026-05-21

### RAM-disk backend + VirtIO 1.x modern virtio-blk-pci driver (1.31.4 cycle scope)

Two bites stacked into one cut per the multi-source convergent audit at `agnosticos/docs/development/ramdisk-virtio-modern-prior-art.md`. Both QEMU-validated; neither has iron exposure (RAM-disk is RAM-only; VirtIO doesn't exist on bare metal).

**Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` — multi-source prior art**: VirtIO 1.x driver ported from OpenBSD `virtio.c` (state-machine shape, polled-only confirmation), FreeBSD `virtio_pci_modern.c` (cap-walk + VQ setup), Linux `virtio_ring.c` (barrier discipline). RAM-disk ported from OpenBSD `rd.c` MINIROOTSIZE + NetBSD `md.c` MD_KMEM_ALLOCATED preallocation pattern. **Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` + `feedback_stop_letter_laddering`**: full plan audit shipped BEFORE any code in `agnosticos/docs/development/ramdisk-virtio-modern-prior-art.md` (§§ 1-10).

#### VirtIO 1.x modern virtio-blk-pci driver — full rewrite of `kernel/core/virtio_blk.cyr` (~500 LOC, replaces 181-LOC transitional 0.9.5)

Drops the legacy port-I/O interface; ports the modern PCI transport per OASIS VirtIO 1.2 §§ 2.1 / 4.1 / 5.2:

- **PCI capability-list discovery** (`vblk_scan_caps`) — walks vendor capabilities (ID `0x09`), classifies each by `cfg_type` byte at cap+3, locates COMMON_CFG / NOTIFY_CFG / ISR_CFG / DEVICE_CFG bases inside the device's MMIO BARs. Validates `bar < 6` and rejects `offset+length` wrap-around per Linux `virtio_pci_modern_dev.c:57-62` security check. Each BAR is UC-remapped via `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` (matches `nvme.cyr:128` / `ahci.cyr:153` pattern). NOTIFY_CFG's trailing `notify_off_multiplier` (LE32 at cap+16) cached for the doorbell formula.
- **Device-ID matching** — accepts BOTH `0x1042` (pure modern, `disable-legacy=on`) AND `0x1001` (transitional, default QEMU `-device virtio-blk-pci`). Cap-list presence is the actual gate, not the device ID — § 4.1.4.10 confirms transitional devices expose modern caps alongside the legacy I/O BAR; a true legacy-only device (`disable-modern=true`) has no caps and fails init gracefully per § 4.1.5.1.1.1.
- **8-step init state machine** (`virtio_blk_init`) per § 3.1.1, including the NEW `FEATURES_OK` readback gate (step 6) — driver MUST set status |= FEATURES_OK, then re-read, then abort with FAILED if the device cleared the bit. NO retry on FEATURES_OK clear (spec § 2.2.2 mandate; easy footgun flagged by all three reference impls).
- **64-bit feature negotiation** (`vblk_negotiate_features`) — 2-iteration `device_feature_select=0/1` read pattern → 64-bit accepted subset → write back via `driver_feature_select=0/1`. Accepts ONLY `VIRTIO_F_VERSION_1` (bit 32, mandatory per § 6.1) + opportunistic `VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO` (bit 5). All other bits deliberately unack'd: `ACCESS_PLATFORM` (kernel has no IOMMU), `RING_PACKED` (split rings are simpler — falls back automatically), `NOTIFICATION_DATA`, `RING_EVENT_IDX`, `INDIRECT_DESC`, `IN_ORDER`, `ORDER_PLATFORM`, `NOTIF_CONFIG_DATA`, `RING_RESET`, `SR_IOV`, `FLUSH` (§ 5.2.6.2 confirms writethrough-equivalent behavior when FLUSH unack'd), `BLK_SIZE`, `TOPOLOGY`, `MQ`, `DISCARD`, `WRITE_ZEROES`, `SECURE_ERASE`, `LIFETIME`, `GEOMETRY`.
- **Capacity** read from DEVICE_CFG offset 0 (le64 sectors in 512-B units) after FEATURES_OK per § 5.2.5.1.
- **Virtqueue 0 setup** (`vblk_setup_queue_0`) — `queue_select=0`, read `queue_size` (QEMU default 256), allocate three independent pmm pages for descriptor / available / used rings (modern split rings have no inter-region padding requirement per § 2.7.2), identity-map each per `nvme.cyr:317-319` pattern, zero, write 64-bit byte-physical addresses to `queue_desc_lo/hi`, `queue_driver_lo/hi`, `queue_device_lo/hi` (no PFN shift — that was 0.9.5), read `queue_notify_off` and cache the per-VQ doorbell address `vblk_q0_notify = notify_base + qno × multiplier`. `queue_enable = 1` MUST be last (§ 4.1.4.3.2).
- **Polled-only operation** — no MSI-X, no ISR byte read. Watches `used->idx` directly per OpenBSD `virtio_pci_poll_intr`'s explicit polled path (the source confirms polled-only is spec-legal: § 4.1.4.5 only requires ISR reads when an interrupt fires).
- **Memory-barrier discipline** (`vblk_do_request`) — `mfence` (encoding `0F AE F0`, same opcode used in `xhci_cmd.cyr:172`) inserted (a) between avail-ring slot write and `avail->idx` increment per § 2.7.13.3.1, and (b) between `used->idx` read and used-ring entry read per § 2.7.13.4.1. All three reference impls flag this as THE critical correctness item — without it the device can race-read a stale slot at the new idx, or the host can read a stale entry's id at the new used.idx.
- **Request framing unchanged from 0.9.5** — same 16-byte header (`le32 type; le32 reserved; le64 sector`) + data + 1-byte status three-descriptor chain. § 2.7.4.2's device-readable-before-device-writable ordering already satisfied. Doorbell: write `le16` queue index (0) to the cached `vblk_q0_notify` address.

Same public surface as 0.9.5 (`vblk_blk_read` / `vblk_blk_write` / `vblk_blk_read_sectors`) so `block.cyr` dispatch and `main.cyr` init order are byte-compatible. Read-only enforcement added: `vblk_blk_write` returns -1 if `VIRTIO_BLK_F_RO` was accepted.

#### RAM-disk block backend — new `kernel/core/ramdisk.cyr` (~140 LOC)

Pure-RAM block device, build-flag gated by new `RAMDISK_ENABLE=1` env var. Convergent port from OpenBSD `rd.c` `MINIROOTSIZE` + NetBSD `md.c` `MD_KMEM_ALLOCATED`:

- Preallocates `RAMDISK_NPAGES_DEFAULT = 64` (256 KB at 8 sectors/page) backing pages from `pmm_alloc` at boot; stores physical addresses in `ramdisk_pages[1024]` (sized for the 128-page max). On any `pmm_alloc` failure mid-init, abandons the partial allocation (matches NVMe/AHCI/xHCI unwind-by-abandon convention; `pmm` has no free path today), leaves `ramdisk_active=0` so `ramdisk_register_block_dev` skips.
- 512-B sectors, indexed via `sector >> 3` → page; `(sector & 7) * 512` → offset within page. Inner I/O loop is bare 64-word `store64`/`load64` (matches `virtio_blk.cyr:160-162` idiom). No lazy alloc, no sparse map, no caching, no DMA, no coherency flushes — RAM IS the cache.
- Identity-shape with existing backends — `ramdisk_blk_read/write/read_sectors` signatures match `vblk_blk_*` / `nvme_blk_*` / `ahci_blk_*` / `msc_blk_*` byte-for-byte (0=success, -1=fail). New `BLK_RAMDISK = 5` tag in `block.cyr` with dispatch arms in `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors`.
- `blk_register_ramdisk` (in `block.cyr`) takes the slot only when `blk_active == BLK_NONE` — lowest priority backend. RAM-disk never overrides NVMe / AHCI / USB-MS / VIRTIO. Annotates the log line with which higher-priority backend held the slot (matches `msc_register_block_dev` pattern): `ramdisk: 512 LBAs x 512B (64 pages; virtio primary)` or `(...; active)` when RAM-disk holds the slot.
- Sizing matches OpenBSD `MINIROOTSIZE` precedent (the only impl in the audit with a default). 256 KB ≈ 18% of archaemenid's post-boot ~354-page pmm budget — fits FAT12 / minixfs bring-up, leaves kernel margin. Audit-capped at 128 pages (512 KB) until pmm budget grows; build-time bound enforced via `RAMDISK_NPAGES_MAX = 128`.
- CMOS kcp `0x52` stamps on successful registration; extends storage kcp arc `0x40` – `0x51` (NVMe / GPT / AHCI / USB-MS).

Build-flag plumbing in `scripts/build.sh` follows the existing `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE` / `AHCI_RW_DEMO` / `MSC_RW_DEMO` pattern (env var → prepended `#define`). Production boots default off → zero pmm cost.

#### Init order, `main.cyr`

```
1. virtio_blk_init        (accepts 0x1042 OR 0x1001; cap-presence gates)
2. #ifdef RAMDISK_ENABLE  ramdisk_init + ramdisk_register_block_dev  #endif
3. nvme_*                 (overrides whatever's in the slot if present)
4. ahci_*                 (secondary if NVMe, otherwise overrides VIRTIO/RAMDISK)
5. msc_register_block_dev (tertiary; overrides only NONE/VIRTIO/RAMDISK)
```

Effective priority: NVMe > AHCI > USB-MS > VirtIO > RAMDISK > NONE.

#### `block.cyr` extension

- New `BLK_RAMDISK = 5` tag
- New `blk_register_ramdisk(capacity, lba_bytes)` — only takes the slot if `blk_active == BLK_NONE`
- New dispatch arms in `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors`

#### QEMU smoke validation — 5/5 GREEN

1. **Baseline** (no virtio device, `RAMDISK_ENABLE=0`) — boots to `AGNOS shell v1.31.3`, no block backend active, no regression.
2. **RAMDISK alone** (`RAMDISK_ENABLE=1`, no virtio device) — `ramdisk: 512 LBAs x 512B (64 pages; active)`, boot reaches shell.
3. **Modern virtio-blk-pci** (`-device virtio-blk-pci,drive=blk,disable-legacy=on,disable-modern=off` + 8 MB scratch backing) — `VirtIO-blk: 16384 sectors` (8 MiB / 512 B = 16384 exact), boot reaches shell. Modern-only cap-list path validated end-to-end.
4. **Transitional virtio-blk-pci** (`-device virtio-blk-pci,drive=blk` — default QEMU, device ID `0x1001` with modern caps present) — `VirtIO-blk: 16384 sectors`, same outcome via cap-list scan, legacy I/O BAR ignored. Modern caps path correctly drives the transitional device.
5. **Combined** (`RAMDISK_ENABLE=1` + `-device virtio-blk-pci,...`) — `VirtIO-blk: 16384 sectors` followed by `ramdisk: 512 LBAs x 512B (64 pages; virtio primary)`, then `AGNOS shell`. Priority policy works correctly: virtio holds `blk_active`, RAM-disk allocated and known but secondary.

No iron exposure for the new bites themselves (RAM-disk is `pmm_alloc`-backed; VirtIO has no device to enumerate on bare metal); the 1.31.x storage arc's iron coverage stays NVMe + SATA + USB-MS as of 1.31.3. **The 1.31.4 binary IS iron-validated at Attempt 88 on archaemenid as a no-regression burn** — full storage trio re-registered cleanly (NVMe primary / AHCI secondary / USB MS tertiary), GPT parsed, kernel reached scheduler init (`Timer ticks before sched: 6`). Photos at `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-88-agnos-1.31.4-iron-debut-pt{1,2}-*.jpg`; entry at `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 88. RAM-disk-on-iron deferred as a non-pinned follow-up (rebuild with `RAMDISK_ENABLE=1` and re-burn to see the `ramdisk:` print on archaemenid; low information value since RAM-disk is `pmm_alloc`-backed — only worth it for CHANGELOG completeness — tracked in `agnosticos/docs/development/roadmap.md`, scheduled before 1.35.0).

#### Build trajectory

`build/agnos`: **510,536 B → 520,920 B** (default, `RAMDISK_ENABLE=0`, +10,384 B / +2.0% for modern virtio rewrite net of the 181-LOC transitional retirement) → **520,952 B** (`RAMDISK_ENABLE=1`, +32 B over default for the two `main.cyr` call sites; ramdisk.cyr functions compile in both modes — 3 additional dead-code fns when disabled, eliminable via `CYRIUS_DCE=1`).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 2.8 — eight-bug repair stack (post-Attempt-86 carry-forward)

Closes the post-Attempt-86 audit — Phase 2.7's multi-source-converged Reset Recovery LANDED correctly on iron (`Reset Recovery OK` × 3 in the boot transcript, no `Reset Endpoint failed` regression of Attempt 85) but the TUR retries that followed each successful recovery all failed with "CSW signature mismatch". Audit found EIGHT distinct bugs cascading from a single root cause — `XHCI_CMD_TIMEOUT_SPINS=10M` (~25–50ms wall on Zen) was being applied to bulk transfers too, abandoning live INQUIRY data phases as wedged. Real Silicon Motion / generic-vendor USB sticks routinely NAK bulk-IN for 50–200ms before first response; the old timeout was systematically declaring healthy transfers dead.

Per [`feedback_stop_letter_laddering`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_stop_letter_laddering.md) — escape plan written BEFORE the next iron burn, not after another falsification. Per [`feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent.md) — every patch backed by Linux + FreeBSD + xHCI 1.2 spec prior art. Per [`feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work.md) — full eight-patch stack lands in ONE burn, no incremental laddering.

- **Bulk timeout extension** (`xhci_cmd.cyr` new `XHCI_BULK_TIMEOUT_SPINS = 200_000_000` ≈ 1s wall, separate enum from cmd-ring timeout). The root cause. Cmd-ring 10M tuned for Enable Slot / Address Device (microseconds); applying it to bulk transfers was abandoning the INQUIRY data phase mid-flight. Linux `USB_CTRL_GET_TIMEOUT=5000ms`; FreeBSD comparable.

- **Strict TRB-pointer matching in transfer-event wait** (`xhci.cyr` new `xhci_wait_transfer_for_trb(slot_id, expected_trb_phys, expected_len)` + `xhci_last_xfer_bytes` global). The previous `xhci_wait_transfer_event(slot_id)` matched on slot_id only — stale completion events for prior wedged TRBs got consumed as if they were the new transfer's event (Attempt 86's "CSW tag mismatch" on TUR #0 was a late INQUIRY CSW delivery being attributed to TUR's CSW receive). New helper matches on `(slot_id, TRB pointer)` from event dword 0; skips and consumes mismatched events without returning false success. Mirrors Linux `drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c handle_tx_event`.

- **SHORT_PACKET residue check** (`xhci_wait_transfer_for_trb` body). Previous code returned success on `XHCI_CC_SHORT_PACKET` without inspecting `event_dword_2 bits 23:0` (residue = unfulfilled byte count). When residue == expected_length (0 bytes actually transferred — device sent ZLP), we were reading an uninitialized buffer past the partial-DMA-write boundary. **Direct cause of Attempt 86's repeating "CSW signature mismatch"**: device's ZLP-then-real-CSW pattern after Reset Recovery left `csw_phys[0..3] = 0` (page-zero), sig != 0x53425355.

- **`msc_bbb_exec` transport_failed entry guard** (collapsed into `msc_scsi_exec` wrapper). Previous TUR retry loop ran the first attempt against still-wedged EPs (the INQUIRY-data-timeout's pinned bulk-IN TRB poisoned TUR #0 → "CSW tag mismatch"); Reset Recovery only fired AFTER a failed attempt. New wrapper checks `row + 69` at entry and runs `msc_reset_recovery` BEFORE the first attempt if sticky is set. Linux `usb_stor_invoke_transport` pattern.

- **Reposition drain in Reset Recovery** (`msc.cyr msc_reset_recovery` step 7 ← previously step 5). Stop Endpoint × 2 in steps 5a/5b posts Transfer Events for any pinned in-flight TRBs (per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.9.1). Pre-Stop drain (Phase 2.7's old position) drained an empty ring; those events landed AFTER and got consumed by the next BBB exec's wait. Linux drains in `handle_stopped_endpoint`.

- **Unified retry+recover wrapper for all SCSI commands** (`msc.cyr` new `msc_scsi_exec(slot, lun, cdb, cdb_len, data, data_len, dir_in, max_retries)`). Single retry shell wrapping `msc_bbb_exec`; runs Reset Recovery between failed attempts. INQUIRY/TUR/RC10/RS/READ(10)/WRITE(10) all migrated. Subsumes the hand-rolled TUR retry loop in `msc_probe_slot` (now a single `msc_test_unit_ready` call). Linux `usb_stor_invoke_transport`.

- **Stop Endpoint on transfer-event timeout** (collapsed into entry guard). Wedged EPs no longer linger Running with pinned TRBs between operations — `msc_scsi_exec`'s entry guard fires `msc_reset_recovery` (which Stop-Endpoints both directions) before any post-failure retry.

- **`xhci_cmd_set_tr_dequeue` full 64-bit phys** (`xhci_cmd.cyr`). `param_hi` was hardcoded 0; now `(deq_ptr_phys >> 32) & 0xFFFFFFFF`. Worked on archaemenid (PMM stays <4GB) but malformed for any future high-memory ring placement.

**QEMU validation** (q35 + OVMF + gnoboot 0.4.2 + agnos 1.31.3 + `-device qemu-xhci -device usb-storage,bus=xhci.0,drive=stick` against 8 MB scratch `usb.img`):

```
msc: slot 1 BBB intf=0 bulk-IN=129 bulk-OUT=2 MPS(in/out)=1024/1024 MaxLUN=0
msc: slot 1 INQUIRY: vendor='QEMU' product='QEMU HARDDISK' rev='2.5+' type=block
msc: slot 1 TEST UNIT READY -> ready (Pass)
msc: slot 1 READ CAPACITY: last_lba=16383 blk=512B -> 8 MiB
msc: 1 mass-storage device(s) detected
msc: registered as tertiary block_dev (slot 1, 16384 LBAs x 512B; AHCI primary)
msc: slot 1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
AGNOS shell v1.31.3 (type 'help')
```

All four QEMU gates green: INQUIRY decoded, RC10 = 8 MiB, TUR ready, boot complete. No regression of the QEMU-side Phase 1-4 baseline.

**Iron Attempt 87 success rubric**: install agnos 1.31.3 on archaemenid; plug the same Silicon Motion stick (`VID=0x090C PID=0x1000`). Expected: (a) full — `xhci: bulk transfer event timeout` does NOT appear; INQUIRY succeeds first try (with possible 1 retry); TUR Pass; RC10 prints last_lba + blk; tertiary registration line; LBA-0 readback. (b) partial — Reset Recovery still fires but at least one round eventually succeeds (TUR Pass or INQUIRY data lands). (c) failure — same "CSW signature mismatch" loop = new bug class beyond the eight-bug audit.

**MVP gate posture:** unaffected. `msc_probe_slot` returns 1 regardless of post-Configure-EP failures; boot-to-shell stays green. USB MS arc remains opportunistic.

**Build:** 475,096 B (1.31.2 baseline) → **502,072 B** (+26,976 B / +5.7% for the eight-patch stack: new `XHCI_BULK_TIMEOUT_SPINS` enum + `xhci_wait_transfer_for_trb` + `xhci_last_xfer_bytes` + `msc_scsi_exec` wrapper + `msc_bbb_exec` rewrite + Reset Recovery reorder + Set TR Dequeue 64-bit fix + comments).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_cmd.cyr` (`XHCI_BULK_TIMEOUT_SPINS` enum, `xhci_cmd_set_tr_dequeue` full 64-bit phys), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr` (`xhci_wait_transfer_for_trb` + `xhci_last_xfer_bytes`), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (`msc_bulk_enqueue` returns TRB phys, `msc_bbb_exec` rewritten with strict TRB matching + residue check, `msc_scsi_exec` new wrapper, INQUIRY/TUR/RC10/RS/READ/WRITE migrated, Reset Recovery drain repositioned, `msc_probe_slot` TUR loop simplified to single call).

## [1.31.2] — 2026-05-21

### USB Mass Storage Phase 2.7 — multi-source-converged Reset Recovery hardening (post-Attempt-85 carry-forward, pre-Attempt-86 build)

Closes the four-patch carry-forward from Attempt 85's FALSIFIED outcome (Phase 2.6's `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint` returned non-Success completion code, aborting recovery before Set TR Dequeue Pointer could fire). Post-burn code-read against xHCI 1.2 §4.6.8 surfaced the root cause: Reset Endpoint is only legal from Halted state, but Attempt 84/85's transport wedge is a transfer-event timeout — the EP never entered Halted; Stop Endpoint left it in Stopped; Reset Endpoint on Stopped returned `Context State Error` (CC=19).

Per [`feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent.md) (refreshed 2026-05-21 with hard "multi-source" rule after user feedback "LINUX ISN'T THE ONLY RESOURCE OF PRIOR ART"): four-source convergent audit (**FreeBSD** `sys/dev/usb/storage/umass.c` + `sys/dev/usb/controller/xhci.c`; **OpenBSD** `sys/dev/usb/umass.c`; **EDK2** `MdeModulePkg/Bus/Usb/UsbMassStorageDxe/UsbMassBot.c`; **Linux** `drivers/usb/storage/transport.c` + `drivers/usb/host/xhci.c` — confirmatory only, not load-bearing). Full audit in [`agnosticos/docs/development/msc-reset-recovery-prior-art.md` § 9](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/msc-reset-recovery-prior-art.md). Per [`feedback_no_letter_codes_for_repairs`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/.claude/projects/-home-macro-Repos-agnosticos/memory/feedback_no_letter_codes_for_repairs.md): named for what they do.

- **Reset Endpoint CSE tolerance** (`xhci_cmd.cyr` `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint`). Defensive backstop — `XHCI_CC_CONTEXT_STATE_ERROR` returned as success the same way `xhci_cmd_stop_endpoint` already does. Per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.8, Reset Endpoint on a non-Halted EP is harmless — Stop Endpoint already put the EP in the destination state Reset Endpoint would produce from Halted; Set TR Dequeue Pointer at the end of recovery does the actual resync. Treating CSE as success lets recovery proceed for timeout-wedged (non-STALL) endpoints, where the EP transitions Running → Stopped without ever entering Halted.

- **EP-state-aware Reset Endpoint dispatch** (`xhci_ctx.cyr` new `xhci_ep_state(slot_id, dci)` + `xhci_regs.cyr` new `XhciEpState` enum + `msc.cyr` step 7). New helper reads Output EP Context dword 0 bits 0-2 per xHCI 1.2 §6.2.3 (`XHCI_EP_STATE_DISABLED=0 / RUNNING=1 / HALTED=2 / STOPPED=3 / ERROR=4`). `msc_reset_recovery` step 7 gates `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint` on `XHCI_EP_STATE_HALTED`; STOPPED / RUNNING / DISABLED skip the command entirely. Mirrors FreeBSD `xhci_get_endpoint_state` + `xhci_configure_reset_endpoint` switch.

- **100ms post-BOT-Reset device stall** (`msc.cyr` step 2). 50M-iteration busy-wait between Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset and CLEAR_FEATURE(HALT). Calibrated against existing 5M ≈ 5-10ms loop at `msc.cyr:369`. Matches EDK2's explicit `gBS->Stall(USB_BOT_RESET_DEVICE_STALL)`; FreeBSD's implicit 50ms `.interval` between RESET1 → RESET2; Linux's `msleep(100)` in `usb_stor_Bulk_reset`. Spec rationale per USB MSC BBB §6.7.3: "The device shall NAK the host's request until the reset is complete." **Highest-confidence fix in the Phase 2.7 stack** — Attempt 84's "Reset Recovery OK but transport stays wedged across retries" matches a CLEAR_FEATURE arriving mid-device-reset → silent NAK → recovery completes structurally but transport stays wedged on retry.

- **Reset Recovery step reorder: device-side first** (`msc.cyr` full `msc_reset_recovery` body). New canonical order: (1) Bulk-Only MS Reset → (2) 100ms stall → (3-4) CLEAR_FEATURE(HALT)×2 → (5) drain stale Transfer Events → (6) Stop Endpoint×2 → (7) Reset Endpoint×2 (Halted-gated) → (8) host-side ring rewind → (9) Set TR Dequeue×2 → (10) clear `transport_failed` sticky. Matches convergent reference ordering across all four impls — device sees a clean reset first, then controller state is resynced to match. Previous Phase 2.6 order (controller-side first, then device-side) was AGNOS-specific; no other reference impl does it that way.

**Iron-validation gate at Attempt 86**: install agnos 1.31.2 `[Unreleased]` HEAD on archaemenid, plug the same Silicon Motion stick used at Attempts 84/85 (`VID=0x090C PID=0x1000`). Success rubric per [`msc-reset-recovery-prior-art.md` § 9.4](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/msc-reset-recovery-prior-art.md): (a) full — TUR Pass on retry 2/3 + INQUIRY + RC10 + tertiary registration; (b) partial — Reset Recovery completes, sense data printed (SCSI-layer issue, transport fixed); (c) partial — Reset Recovery still wedges (Phase 2.8 territory; re-read prior art for missed step); (d) failure — new error line not seen before (code bug in 2.7).

**MVP gate posture:** unaffected. `msc_probe_slot` already returns 1 even on transport failure (Phase 1-4 design), so MVP boot-to-shell stays green regardless of Attempt 86 outcome. USB MS arc is opportunistic — closed beta MVP depends on kybernet + agnoshi + kernel-on-iron, not on a specific block backend.

**Build:** 499,736 B (Attempt 85 / Phase 2.6) → **499,816 B** (+80 B for the Phase 2.7 stack — comments + 50M-iter delay loop + `xhci_ep_state` helper + EP-state dispatch in `msc_reset_recovery`).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_cmd.cyr` (CSE tolerance on `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint`), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_regs.cyr` (new `XhciEpState` enum: DISABLED/RUNNING/HALTED/STOPPED/ERROR), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ctx.cyr` (new `xhci_ep_state(slot_id, dci)` reader), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (`msc_reset_recovery` body rewritten with device-side-first ordering + 100ms stall + EP-state-aware Reset Endpoint dispatch).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 2.6 — controller-side xHCI command recovery (post-Attempt-84 carry-forward, FALSIFIED at Attempt 85)

Closes the four-patch controller-side carry-forward from Attempt 84's PARTIAL outcome — the burn that proved Phase 2.5 device-side Reset Recovery executed cleanly on iron but device transport stayed wedged across retries. The Phase 2.6 hypothesis: xHC's EP context lags pinned at the wedged TRDP because device-side recovery doesn't touch controller state; xHCI 1.2 §4.10.2.1 specifies Stop Endpoint + Reset Endpoint + Set TR Dequeue Pointer as the controller-side half of Halted Endpoint Recovery. Hypothesis was correct in shape but the Reset Endpoint dispatch was wrong — see Phase 2.7 above for the multi-source-converged repair stack that landed in the same release cycle.

- **Three new xHCI command helpers** (`xhci_cmd.cyr`): `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint(slot_id, dci)` (TRB type 14), `xhci_cmd_stop_endpoint(slot_id, dci)` (TRB type 15; tolerates `XHCI_CC_CONTEXT_STATE_ERROR`), `xhci_cmd_set_tr_dequeue(slot_id, dci, deq_ptr_phys, dcs)` (TRB type 16). All three thin wrappers around the existing `xhci_cmd_issue` dispatcher. TRB type constants `XHCI_TRB_RESET_ENDPOINT / XHCI_TRB_STOP_ENDPOINT / XHCI_TRB_SET_TR_DEQUEUE` added to `XhciTrbType` enum in `xhci_regs.cyr`.
- **`xhci_drain_transfer_events(slot_id)`** new helper in `xhci.cyr`. Drains any stale Transfer Events for the given slot from the event ring — addresses the CSW tag mismatch surfaced at Attempt 84 (a late completion for the wedged TRB was being consumed by the next `xhci_wait_transfer_event` as the new transfer's event).
- **`msc_reset_recovery` extended** (`msc.cyr`) with the controller-side commands wrapping the device-side dance: Stop Endpoint→Reset Endpoint→drain events→[Phase 2.5 device-side]→ring rewind→Set TR Dequeue Pointer. Initial ordering had controller-side first; Phase 2.7 reordered to device-side first per multi-source convergence.

**Iron-validation at Attempt 85 2026-05-21 → FALSIFIED**: `msc: Reset Endpoint(bulk-IN) failed` × 2 abort recovery before Set TR Dequeue Pointer can fire. Root cause: `xhci_cmd_reset_endpoint` did not tolerate CSE, and the EP was in Stopped (not Halted) after Stop Endpoint → Reset Endpoint returned CSE → recovery aborted. Phase 2.7 fixes this with state-aware dispatch.

**Build:** 496,656 B (Phase 2.5) → **499,736 B** (+3,080 B for Phase 2.6 stack: three xHCI command helpers + event-ring drain + `msc_reset_recovery` extension + aarch64 stubs).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_cmd.cyr` (+3 command helpers), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_regs.cyr` (+3 TRB type constants), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr` (+`xhci_drain_transfer_events`), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (`msc_reset_recovery` extended with controller-side commands), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (matching stubs).

Detail in [`iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 85](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).

### AHCI carry-forward — three named patches (post-Attempt-81)

Cleans up the three follow-up surfaces from the 1.31.1 AHCI iron debut (Attempt 81 on archaemenid + WD Blue SA510). Read-only investigation found that hypothesis #1 from the carry-forward (PxIS not W1C-cleared between commands) is **wrong** — both `ahci_identify_device` and `ahci_issue_rw` already clear PxIS + PxSERR before issuing. The actual gap is narrower: neither function waits for **controller quiescence** before issuing the next command.

- **`ahci_port_wait_idle(port)` — new helper, called pre-issue in both `ahci_identify_device` and `ahci_issue_rw`.** Polls until PxTFD.STS.BSY=0 + DRQ=0 (device idle), PxCI=0 (no slots in flight), and PxSACT=0 (no NCQ slots active). Matches Linux's `ata_qc_issue` / `ahci_qc_issue` pattern (drivers/ata/libahci.c). Hypothesis: on QEMU the controller transitions to idle instantly after R/W completion; on real silicon (WD SA510 SATA Gen3 6 Gbps on AMD FCH AHCI 1.3) the device-side completion → controller-side slot-release lag is non-zero, and the post-RW IDENTIFY in `ahci_register_block_dev` issued before that lag cleared. PxCI bit 0 stayed set, poll exhausted AHCI_TIMEOUT_SPINS (1M iterations) without completion. One `ahci_port_wait_idle(port)` at the top of each issuer closes this — single-burn fix per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` / `feedback_known_knowledge_first`, no letter ladder.
- **`ahci_print_id_string` right-trims trailing spaces.** ATA8-ACS § 7.16.7 fixes IDENTIFY model (40 B) / serial (20 B) / firmware (8 B) as space-padded fixed-width fields. AGNOS's byte-swap printer was outputting the full padded width with trailing whitespace; matches Linux's `ata_id_c_string` (drivers/ata/libata-core.c) by scanning the printed-char sequence back from the end to the last non-0x20 byte. Byte-swap means printed-char-index `k` maps to field-byte `k XOR 1` (even `k` → `k+1`, odd `k` → `k-1`) — the scan honors that mapping.
- **`ahci_rw_demo` split behind `AHCI_RW_DEMO` compile gate.** Splits the previous unconditional read-LBA0 + write-LBA5 + read-back demo into `ahci_read_demo` (always on; LBA 0 readback only, no disk writes) + `ahci_write_demo` (`#ifdef AHCI_RW_DEMO`; the LBA-5 sentinel write + read-back). Default off matches the 1.31.0 cycle-open production-lean posture (alongside `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE`); QEMU smoke retains the write-path validation via `AHCI_RW_DEMO=1 ./scripts/build.sh`. Documented in `docs/development/build.md` alongside the existing gates. Iron builds against drives the user cares about no longer ship a sentinel write to LBA 5 (where the GPT partition-entry array lives on a standard-layout disk).

**Files changed:** `kernel/core/ahci.cyr` (new `ahci_port_wait_idle` helper at the top of the file, wait-idle calls inserted in `ahci_identify_device` + `ahci_issue_rw`, `ahci_print_id_string` rewritten with right-trim, `ahci_rw_demo` split into `ahci_read_demo` + `#ifdef AHCI_RW_DEMO ahci_write_demo`), `kernel/core/main.cyr` (call site updated to `ahci_read_demo()` + `#ifdef AHCI_RW_DEMO ahci_write_demo() #endif`), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (matching stub split + new `ahci_port_wait_idle` stub), `scripts/build.sh` (`AHCI_RW_DEMO=1` honored alongside `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE`), `docs/development/build.md` (new flag row + usage example).

### Cyrius pin graduation 5.11.64 → 6.0.1 (iron-validated at Attempt 82)

Lifts the kernel pin off the v5.11.64 gvar-init-order anchor onto cycc 6.0.1, the first v6.x-class toolchain. v5.11.64 was the patch that closed the gvar-init-order zero-reads root-cause of the FF→QQ+QQ2 silent-absorb arc (Attempts 57-63) and served as the kernel's stable build floor through the 1.30.x FB hardening arc + the 1.31.0 / 1.31.1 storage-arc cuts. v5.11.x closed at 5.11.69 on 2026-05-19; v6.0.0 cycle opened the same day with the `cyrc → cybs` + `cc5 → cycc` binary-name rename ceremony, and the .1 patch closed a same-day UEFI-emit `fncallN` regression. Back-compat symlinks (`cc5 → cycc`, `cyrc → cybs`) shipped in `cyrius/scripts/install.sh` keep v5.11.x-pinned consumers building unchanged through the v6.0.x window — graduation is opt-in per repo on natural-next-touch.

**What lifts:**
- `cyrius.cyml`: `cyrius = "5.11.64"` → `cyrius = "6.0.1"`. Single-line bump.
- No kernel-side code changes — the 1.31.0/1.31.1 storage-arc engineering (NVMe Phase 1-5, AHCI/SATA Phase 1-4, GPT Phase 1-3) + the 1.31.2 AHCI carry-forward triplet all compiled clean against cycc 6.0.1 on the first attempt.

**Why graduate mid-cycle rather than at 1.32.0**: closes the toolchain-drift warning state.md fired throughout the 1.31.x session (`cyrius.cyml pins 5.11.64 but cycc is 6.0.1`); aligns agnos with the broader v6.0.x leading-edge cluster forming through 2026-05-20 (mihi 1.0.0, iam 1.0.0, chakshu 0.6.0, bannermanor 1.0.0, darshana 0.3.5, hapi 0.5.0 — agnoshi followed in the same MVP-path pair); cuts the lag-spectrum's 5.11.64 holdout count down to the boot-path bedrock (kybernet + argonaut still at 5.10.44 — these graduate next).

**Iron validation (Attempt 82, 2026-05-20):** First iron burn of agnos compiled by the v6.0.x toolchain. Boot output matches Attempt 80 / 81 baseline shape end-to-end through to `AGNOS shell v1.31.2`; no behavioral regression introduced by the toolchain swap. NVMe (Crucial P3 2 TB) enumerates + registers as primary block_dev + GPT-parses cleanly (`hdr-CRC-OK arr-CRC-OK`); AHCI (WD Blue SA510 2 TB) enumerates + registers as secondary + the post-RW IDENTIFY (which timed out at Attempt 81 on cycc 5.11.64) clears via the carry-forward `ahci_port_wait_idle` gate. The Attempt-82 burn is therefore a joint validation of both the AHCI carry-forward triplet AND the cyrius v6.0.x lift — both clean on first iron try.

Detail in [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 82](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md). State.md pin-lag spectrum updated to record agnos's exit from the 5.11.64 holdout slot.

**Files changed:** `cyrius.cyml` (one line).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 1 (BBB class-interface discovery + bulk endpoint enumeration + GET_MAX_LUN)

First engineering cut of the **USB Mass Storage** arc — third iron-validatable block backend after NVMe + AHCI. New `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (~290 LOC, 3,840 B compiled) does pure read-only discovery: walks each addressed xHCI slot's Configuration Descriptor for an Interface Descriptor matching the MSC-BBB class triple (class=0x08 / subclass=0x06 [SCSI transparent] / protocol=0x50 [Bulk-Only Transport]), locates bulk-IN + bulk-OUT endpoints within that interface, issues SET_CONFIGURATION + GET_MAX_LUN, and stashes per-slot state in a 4 KB lazy-allocated table. No bulk transfers, no CBW/CSW, no SCSI — Phase 2-3-4 territory.

Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`, Linux's `drivers/usb/storage/usb.c` + `transport.c` are the structural references; USB MSC BBB rev 1.0 (USB-IF, 1999) is the protocol reference. Phase 1's shape mirrors NVMe Phase 1 + AHCI Phase 1: probe-only enumeration that earns the "device class is alive in the kernel" line in the boot log without changing any other subsystem's behavior.

**What it does:**
- **`xhci_find_msc_bbb_endpoints(total_length, ...)`** — Configuration Descriptor walker analogous to `xhci_find_hid_boot_kbd_endpoint`. State machine: scan TLVs sequentially, track whether we are currently inside a matched MSC-BBB interface (class 0x08 / subclass 0x06 / protocol 0x50), on each endpoint descriptor classify by direction (`bEndpointAddress` bit 7) + transfer type (`bmAttributes` bits 1:0 = 2 for bulk). Captures the first bulk-IN + first bulk-OUT pair found inside the interface; alternate settings that switch interfaces reset the endpoint accumulators (so an unmatched alt-setting's stray endpoints don't poison the bulk-EP capture). Returns 1 only when both bulk-IN and bulk-OUT are found.
- **`msc_get_max_lun(slot_id, interface)`** — class-specific control request (USB MSC BBB §3.2): `bmRequestType=0xA1 / bRequest=0xFE / wValue=0 / wIndex=interface / wLength=1`. Returns the highest LUN number this device supports (0 = single-LUN, the overwhelmingly common case for thumb drives). Some devices STALL this request rather than reply; per spec a STALL means "single-LUN, treat as MaxLUN=0" — handled by returning 0 on `xhci_control_in` failure.
- **`msc_probe_slot(slot_id)`** — per-slot Phase 1 driver. Issues GET_CONFIGURATION_DESCRIPTOR (9-byte header to learn `wTotalLength`, then full), runs the walker, on success issues SET_CONFIGURATION (USB 2.0 §9.4.7 — bulk endpoints aren't operational until the device is Configured; same gate as HID-kbd Step 2.5), calls `msc_get_max_lun`, stashes per-slot row in a 4 KB lazy-allocated table indexed by slot_id, prints one-line summary.
- **`msc_enumerate()`** — top-level Phase 1 driver, called from `main.cyr` after the HID-kbd configure loop. Iterates slots 1..64, calls `msc_probe_slot` on each that has an allocated input context. HID-kbd already grabbed its slot if a keyboard was present; MSC probe is a different class-triple match and won't conflict. Prints summary `msc: <N> mass-storage device(s) detected (Phase 1 — discovery only)`. Stamps CMOS kcp `0x52` once at least one MSC slot completes Phase 1 — continues the storage-arc sequence 0x40-0x48 NVMe / 0x49-0x4A GPT P1-2 / 0x4B-0x4D AHCI P1 / 0x4E AHCI P2 / 0x4F AHCI P3 / 0x50 AHCI P4 / 0x51 GPT P3 / **0x52 MSC P1**.

**What it does NOT do (Phase 2+ territory):**
- Bulk transfer primitives — no bulk Normal TRBs queued on the bulk EPs, no transfer-event polling for bulk completions. xHCI currently only operates control (EP0) + interrupt-IN (HID-kbd) endpoints; bulk-IN + bulk-OUT plumbing is Phase 2.
- Command Block Wrapper (CBW) issue + Command Status Wrapper (CSW) receipt — the BBB transport protocol's request/response shape, Phase 2.
- SCSI commands — INQUIRY (0x12), TEST UNIT READY (0x00), READ CAPACITY(10) (0x25), READ(10) (0x28), WRITE(10) (0x2A). All Phase 3-4.
- Block-layer registration — `BLK_USB_MS = 4` constant landed in `block.cyr`, but no `blk_register_usb_ms()` function yet; that comes online when Phase 4's READ(10) / WRITE(10) ship. Dispatch policy at registration: NVMe primary, AHCI secondary, USB MS tertiary — `blk_active=BLK_USB_MS` only when no other backend is present.
- MSI/MSI-X IRQ-driven completion — polling-only, per xhci + nvme + ahci precedent.

**Block-layer constant:** New `var BLK_USB_MS = 4;` in `kernel/core/block.cyr` reserves the dispatch tag for Phase 4's registration call. No dispatch arm added yet — `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors` stay at the existing 3-backend dispatch (VIRTIO/NVME/AHCI).

**QEMU validation** (q35 + OVMF + gnoboot 0.4.2 + agnos 1.31.2 `[Unreleased]` + `-device qemu-xhci,id=xhci -device usb-storage,bus=xhci.0,drive=stick` against an 8 MB scratch `usb.img`):

```
xhci: port 1 connected, SS, slot=1, VID=18164 PID=1, class=0
hid: keyboard layer initialized
hid: no HID-boot-kbd interface in config
msc: slot 1 BBB intf=0 bulk-IN=129 bulk-OUT=2 MPS(in/out)=1024/1024 MaxLUN=0
msc: 1 mass-storage device(s) detected (Phase 1 — discovery only)
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 131072 LBAs x 512B)

gpt: present, first=34 last=131038 parts=1/128 hdr-CRC-OK arr-CRC-OK
...
AGNOS shell v1.31.2 (type 'help')
agnos>
```

Decoded values:
- VID=18164 = `0x46F4`, PID=1 = `0x0001` — QEMU's standard `usb-storage` device IDs.
- `class=0` on the device descriptor — `bDeviceClass=0` means "interface-defined", which is the typical USB Mass Storage shape. The MSC walker correctly drops to the Interface Descriptor for the class triple match.
- `bulk-IN=129` = `0x81` (bit 7 set = IN direction, EP1), `bulk-OUT=2` = `0x02` (EP2). Standard QEMU usb-storage endpoint layout.
- `MPS(in/out)=1024/1024` — SuperSpeed bulk MPS. The device negotiated SS on xhci port 1 (`SS` in the connection line); HS would have shown 512.
- `MaxLUN=0` — single-LUN device (the common case).

**HID-kbd interaction:** The HID-kbd configure loop runs first and walks the same Configuration Descriptor of slot 1 looking for a HID-boot keyboard interface — it correctly returns "no HID-boot-kbd interface in config" without claiming the slot. MSC then probes the same slot, matches its class triple, and succeeds. Two class drivers coexist cleanly on the same xhci slot iteration.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 474,600 B (1.31.2 AHCI carry-forward HEAD) → **478,440 B** (+3,840 B for the msc.cyr module + aarch64 stubs + main.cyr wiring + block.cyr constant). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope (iron):** Phase 1 is pure read-only enumeration; no behavioral path lands new on iron until at least Phase 3 (first SCSI command issued through bulk transport). An iron burn at any time post-Phase-1 would validate the discovery on archaemenid's actual USB stack — confirms xhci ports enumerate a real USB stick + the class triple match works on real-vendor descriptors + GET_MAX_LUN doesn't STALL — but offers little behavioral information beyond what QEMU already showed. Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work`, batch with Phase 2-3-4 once a usable USB MS block backend exists. The pre-burn audit lives in `agnosticos/docs/development/usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` — opens when Phase 4 is ready.

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (new, 290 LOC), `kernel/agnos.cyr` (include line), `kernel/core/main.cyr` (`msc_enumerate()` call after HID-kbd loop), `kernel/core/block.cyr` (`BLK_USB_MS=4` constant), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (matching stubs).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 2 (bulk-EP Configure Endpoint + CBW/CSW BBB transport + TEST UNIT READY)

Second engineering cut of the USB Mass Storage arc, same session as Phase 1. Lights up the **Bulk-Only Transport** half of the protocol: bulk-IN + bulk-OUT endpoint configuration, transfer-ring allocation, Normal-TRB bulk transfer primitives, full CBW → (optional data) → CSW round-trip, and TEST UNIT READY (SCSI 0x00) as the smallest data-phase-free SCSI command for smoke validation. Linux's `drivers/usb/storage/transport.c` § `usb_stor_Bulk_transport` is the structural reference; USB MSC BBB §5.1 (CBW) + §5.2 (CSW) the protocol reference.

**What it does:**
- **`xhci_input_ctx_add_bulk_pair(ictx, in_ep, in_mps, out_ep, out_mps, speed, in_ring, out_ring)`** — new in `xhci_ctx.cyr`. Adds the MSC-BBB bulk-IN + bulk-OUT endpoint pair to an Input Context in a single Configure Endpoint pass. EP Type values per xHCI 1.2 Table 6-9: bulk-OUT = 2, bulk-IN = 6. Sets Add Flags = `A0 | A_in_dci | A_out_dci` (drops A1 / EP0 per the same stale-EP0-DQ rationale as `_add_interrupt_in`); bumps Slot Context's Context Entries (bits 31:27) to cover the highest of the two new DCIs. EP context fields per direction: CErr=3, EP Type, MPS in upper half of dword 1, TR Dequeue Pointer with DCS=1 in dword 8-9, Avg TRB Length = MPS in dword 16. Max Burst defaults to 0 (Phase 2 doesn't parse the SuperSpeed Companion Descriptor; SS devices may run slower than peak — refine when MB > 0 becomes a perf concern).
- **`msc_alloc_bulk_ring()`** — allocates a 4 KB transfer-ring page (zeroed, mapped, IOMMU-registered), writes a Link TRB at the last slot pointing back to the ring base with Toggle Cycle = 1. Phase 2's tiny transfers never wrap to use the Link, but it's in place for future ring-wrapping correctness without a separate code path.
- **`msc_bulk_enqueue(slot_id, is_in, data_phys, length)`** — pushes a single Normal TRB onto the appropriate bulk ring (xHCI 1.2 §6.4.1.1). Encoding: dword 0-1 = Data Buffer Pointer; dword 2 = TRB Transfer Length in bits 16:0, TD Size = 0 (single-TRB TD); dword 3 = Cycle | IOC | ISP (for IN direction only) | type=Normal(1)<<10. Advances per-direction cycle bit + index, rings the slot/DCI doorbell.
- **`msc_configure_endpoints(slot_id)`** — orchestrates Phase 2 bring-up for one slot: allocates two transfer rings + CBW (31 B) scratch + CSW (13 B) scratch (each a 4 KB page from pmm_alloc, unused tail harmless), stashes ring/CBW/CSW phys + DCIs + initial cycle in the row, calls `xhci_input_ctx_add_bulk_pair` + `xhci_configure_endpoint`. Sets `endpoints_ready = 1` on success. Logs `msc: Configure Endpoint failed` and returns 0 on any alloc / command failure (boot continues; the device just isn't reachable via bulk).
- **`msc_build_cbw(slot_id, lun, cdb_phys, cdb_len, data_len, dir_in)`** — populates the 31-byte CBW at the row's scratch buffer (USB MSC BBB §5.1): `dCBWSignature=0x43425355` ('USBC' LE), per-slot host tag counter at offset 4 (echoed in CSW), `dCBWDataTransferLength` (expected data bytes), `bmCBWFlags` bit 7 = direction, `bCBWLUN` low nibble, `bCBWCBLength` 5-bit, CDB bytes 15..15+N. Returns the host tag for later CSW validation.
- **`msc_bbb_exec(slot_id, lun, cdb, cdb_len, data_phys, data_len, dir_in)`** — full three-step BBB round-trip: enqueue CBW on bulk-OUT + wait Transfer Event; if `data_len > 0`, enqueue data TRB on the data-direction EP + wait; enqueue CSW receive on bulk-IN + wait. Validates CSW signature (0x53425355 'USBS' LE), CSW tag (must match CBW tag), and `bCSWStatus` byte: 0 = Pass (return 1), 1 = Command Failed (return 0; caller may retry with REQUEST SENSE), 2 = Phase Error (return 0 + set sticky `transport_failed` byte; needs Reset Recovery — Phase 3 territory). Each waited Transfer Event is timed-out by the existing `xhci_wait_transfer_event`'s spin counter; timeout sets `transport_failed`.
- **`msc_test_unit_ready(slot_id, lun)`** — Phase 2 smoke command. Builds a 6-byte CDB (all-zero — opcode 0x00 = TEST UNIT READY, control = 0), calls `msc_bbb_exec` with no data phase. Returns 1 on CSW status = 0, 0 otherwise (NOT_READY on fresh removable media comes back as Failed → 0; that's a device state, not a transport bug — Phase 3 will REQUEST SENSE to decode).
- **Wiring**: `msc_probe_slot` now follows Phase 1 success with `msc_configure_endpoints` (stamps CMOS kcp `0x53` on success), then `msc_test_unit_ready` against LUN 0 (stamps `0x54` on Pass). Boot output adds `msc: slot N TEST UNIT READY -> ready (Pass)` or `... -> not ready / failed`. Phase 2 failure does NOT abort Phase 1's discovery success line; the device stays enumerated, the boot continues.

**Per-slot row layout (extended)** — the 256-byte row from Phase 1 grows to use offsets 16..69 for Phase 2 state (bulk ring phys, cycle/idx counters per direction, DCIs, CBW/CSW scratch phys, host tag counter, `endpoints_ready` flag, sticky `transport_failed` byte). Documented inline in `msc.cyr`.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x53` (Configure Endpoint succeeded for one slot), `kcp=0x54` (TEST UNIT READY Pass for one slot). Continues storage-arc sequence after `0x52` (MSC Phase 1).

**QEMU validation** (same harness as Phase 1, q35 + OVMF + `-device qemu-xhci,id=xhci -device usb-storage,bus=xhci.0,drive=stick` against 8 MB scratch `usb.img`):

```
xhci: port 1 connected, SS, slot=1, VID=18164 PID=1, class=0
hid: no HID-boot-kbd interface in config
msc: slot 1 BBB intf=0 bulk-IN=129 bulk-OUT=2 MPS(in/out)=1024/1024 MaxLUN=0
msc: slot 1 TEST UNIT READY -> ready (Pass)
msc: 1 mass-storage device(s) detected (Phase 1 — discovery only)
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 131072 LBAs x 512B)
...
AGNOS shell v1.31.2 (type 'help')
```

Decoded round-trip:
- `Configure Endpoint succeeded` (implicit — no failure log printed): bulk-IN at DCI(0x81)=3, bulk-OUT at DCI(0x02)=4 both Running.
- CBW(31 B) → bulk-OUT → Transfer Event ccode=Success.
- No data phase.
- Empty 13-byte buffer posted on bulk-IN → device DMAs CSW → Transfer Event ccode=Success → CSW signature `0x53425355` matched, CSW tag matched CBW tag, `bCSWStatus = 0` → Pass.
- "Phase 1 — discovery only" summary text becomes slightly misleading once Phase 2 lights up; line text updates at Phase 3 when the cycle subtitle widens to cover the data path.

QEMU's emulated `usb-storage` against a regular backing file always returns Ready (no removable-media not-present condition). Iron validation will likely surface NOT_READY transient responses on freshly-inserted USB sticks — Phase 3's REQUEST SENSE handler will decode those.

**Build:** 478,440 B (Phase 1) → **484,992 B** (+6,552 B for Phase 2: bulk-EP pair helper in xhci_ctx, ~340 LOC added to msc.cyr, aarch64 stubs).

**Out of scope (iron):** Phase 2 alone doesn't change the iron value proposition — TEST UNIT READY is a smoke command, not a useful workload. Iron burns batch with Phase 3 (INQUIRY decodes vendor/model/serial, READ CAPACITY decodes drive size) + Phase 4 (READ/WRITE + block-layer registration). Pre-burn audit lives in `agnosticos/docs/development/usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` (opens with Phase 4 ready).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (+~340 LOC), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ctx.cyr` (+`xhci_input_ctx_add_bulk_pair`, ~70 LOC), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (new stubs for Phase 2 entry points).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 3 (SCSI INQUIRY + READ CAPACITY(10))

Third engineering cut of the USB Mass Storage arc. Two SCSI commands with **IN data phases** — first time the data-phase arm of `msc_bbb_exec` (built but unused in Phase 2's TEST UNIT READY) is exercised end-to-end. Together they identify the device + decode the LUN geometry, which is the minimum information Phase 4's block-layer registration needs.

**What it does:**
- **`msc_inquiry(slot_id, lun)`** — SPC-4 §6.6 Standard INQUIRY. 6-byte CDB (`opcode=0x12, AllocLen=36`), 36-byte IN data response. Decodes peripheral qualifier (bits 7:5 of byte 0) + peripheral device type (bits 4:0 — 0x00=block, 0x05=CD/DVD/BD, 0x07=optical, 0x0E=RBC), then copies vendor (8B, offset 8), product (16B, offset 16), revision (4B, offset 32) into the per-slot row at offsets +96/+104/+120/+128/+129. Strings are plain ASCII space-padded (unlike ATA's byte-swap convention — SCSI INQUIRY does not byte-swap).
- **`msc_read_capacity(slot_id, lun)`** — SBC-3 §5.10 READ CAPACITY(10). 10-byte CDB (`opcode=0x25, LBA=0, PMI=0`), 8-byte IN data response. Decodes big-endian u32 last_lba + big-endian u32 block_size into the row at +72/+80. Sets `capacity_done=1` at +85. **Note**: u32 caps at 2 TiB usable (last_lba=0xFFFFFFFF means "use READ CAPACITY(16)" — SBC-3 §5.11 service action 0x10); Phase 4 will add the 16-byte fallback when iron capacity exceeds 2 TiB.
- **`msc_print_ascii_field(p, n)`** — right-trim helper. Scans printed-char sequence from offset 0..n-1, finds last non-space-non-NUL byte, prints inclusive of that index. Matches the convention used in AHCI's `ahci_print_id_string` after the 1.31.2 right-trim patch landed, but without the byte-swap (SCSI fields are plain ASCII).
- **`msc_print_pdt_label(pdt)`** — single-word labels for the common peripheral device types: 0x00 → "block", 0x05/0x07 → "optical", 0x0E → "RBC", else `class=<n>`. Phase 4 doesn't yet differentiate handling by PDT but the surface is in place for Phase 5 (optical 2048-B sectors).
- **Wiring in `msc_probe_slot`**: After Phase 2's TEST UNIT READY Pass, run `msc_inquiry` (stamps CMOS kcp `0x55` on success) + `msc_read_capacity` (stamps `0x56`). Boot output now adds:
    ```
    msc: slot 1 INQUIRY: vendor='QEMU' product='QEMU HARDDISK' rev='2.5+' type=block
    msc: slot 1 READ CAPACITY: last_lba=16383 blk=512B -> 8 MiB
    ```
- **Per-row layout extended** to use offsets +72..+136 for Phase 3 state (last_lba, lba_bytes, inquiry_done flag, capacity_done flag, vendor/product/revision strings, peripheral_qual + peripheral_type bytes, lazy-allocated 4 KB IN data scratch page). Documented inline.

**QEMU validation** — same harness as Phase 1+2 against QEMU's emulated `usb-storage` (vendor=QEMU, product=QEMU HARDDISK, rev=2.5+, last_lba=16383 = 16384 sectors × 512 B = 8 MiB, exactly matching the 8 MB scratch `usb.img` size). PDT=0x00 (Direct-access block device — the standard USB stick / USB HDD classification).

**Build:** 484,992 B (Phase 2) → **488,984 B** (+3,992 B for ~200 LOC of Phase 3 surface).

**Out of scope (iron):** Phase 3 still doesn't change the iron value proposition — INQUIRY tells us the vendor/model and READ CAPACITY tells us the size, but neither exercises a useful workload. Iron burn batches with Phase 4 (block-layer registration + READ(10)/WRITE(10) demos).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (+~200 LOC), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (matching stubs for the new entry points).

### USB Mass Storage Phase 4 (READ(10) + WRITE(10) + block-layer registration + dispatch arms)

Fourth and final engineering cut of the USB Mass Storage arc — lights up the **workload** path. SCSI READ(10) / WRITE(10) commands ride the BBB transport (Phase 2's `msc_bbb_exec`); block-layer registration as the **tertiary** backend (after NVMe + AHCI) wires USB MS into `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors` dispatch; per-priority policy ensures USB MS only becomes `blk_active` when no NVMe + no AHCI are present.

**What it does:**
- **`msc_build_rw10_cdb(cdb_p, opcode, lba, count)`** — 10-byte CDB encoder shared between READ(10) and WRITE(10). Opcode at byte 0, big-endian u32 LBA at bytes 2-5, big-endian u16 Transfer Length (count of LBAs) at bytes 7-8. Flags/Control all zero for Phase 4 (no DPO, no FUA, no RDPROTECT).
- **`msc_read_lba(slot_id, lun, lba, count, buf_phys)`** — issues SCSI READ(10) (opcode 0x28) via `msc_bbb_exec` with `dir_in=1` and `data_len = count * lba_bytes`. Single-Normal-TRB cap: 64 KB (17-bit TRB Transfer Length per xHCI 1.2 §6.4.1.1) → 128 sectors at 512 B/LBA. Returns 1 on success, 0 on transport / CSW failure.
- **`msc_write_lba(slot_id, lun, lba, count, buf_phys)`** — mirror of `msc_read_lba` with opcode 0x2A and `dir_in=0`. Same single-TRB cap.
- **`msc_blk_read(sector, buf)` / `msc_blk_write(sector, buf)`** — single-sector wrappers on `msc_first_slot`, LUN 0. Return 0 on success / -1 on failure to match the existing virtio/nvme/ahci `_blk_*` convention.
- **`msc_blk_read_sectors(start, count, buf)`** — multi-sector wrapper. Chunks requests into `max_per_call = 65535 / blk_bytes` calls (128 sectors at 512 B/LBA), loops through `msc_read_lba` with advancing LBA + buffer pointer. Returns 0 / -1.
- **`msc_register_block_dev()`** — tertiary block-layer registration. Skips if no MSC slot or capacity not known. Policy:
    - `blk_active == BLK_NVME` → log "msc: registered as tertiary block_dev (slot N, ...; NVMe primary)" + return 0 (callable via `msc_*_lba` direct, but not via `blk_*` dispatch).
    - `blk_active == BLK_AHCI` → log "msc: registered as tertiary block_dev (slot N, ...; AHCI primary)" + return 0.
    - else (NONE or VIRTIO) → `blk_register_usb_ms(sectors, blk_bytes)` overrides slot → log "msc: registered as block_dev (slot N, ...)" + stamp CMOS kcp `0x57` + return 1.
- **`msc_read_demo()`** — analogous to `ahci_read_demo`. Unconditional LBA-0 readback through `msc_read_lba`; prints "msc: slot N LBA0 first 8 bytes: ..." Skips silently when `lba_bytes != 512` (e.g., 2048-B optical — Phase 5+ widens). No write side by default.
- **`msc_write_demo()` (gated `#ifdef MSC_RW_DEMO`)** — same safety posture as `AHCI_RW_DEMO`. Writes 8-byte `"MSC-OK!\0"` sentinel to LBA 100, reads back, byte-compares, logs "msc: LBA100 write-then-read round-trip PASS" or MISMATCH. Default OFF: iron builds against drives the user cares about don't ship a sentinel write to LBA 100 (which may sit inside a filesystem). Enable for QEMU smoke or known-scratch USB devices via `MSC_RW_DEMO=1 ./scripts/build.sh`. Documented in `docs/development/build.md` alongside `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE` / `AHCI_RW_DEMO`.

**Block-layer wiring** (`kernel/core/block.cyr`):
- New `fn blk_register_usb_ms(capacity, lba_bytes)` — unconditionally assigns `blk_active=BLK_USB_MS` once called (caller `msc_register_block_dev` enforces the policy gate).
- Dispatch arms added to `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors` for `BLK_USB_MS == 4` → routes to `msc_blk_*`. Storage stack now has all four tag arms (VIRTIO/NVME/AHCI/USB_MS).

**Wiring in `main.cyr`**: `msc_register_block_dev()` runs after the AHCI block-dev register block + before `gpt_init()`. `msc_read_demo()` runs unconditionally; `msc_write_demo()` runs under `#ifdef MSC_RW_DEMO`.

**Build flag**: `scripts/build.sh` honors `MSC_RW_DEMO=1` alongside `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE` / `AHCI_RW_DEMO` — same env-driven prepend mechanism per the v1.31.0 cycle-open production-lean posture.

**QEMU validation** — two smokes:

1. **Default build** (no MSC_RW_DEMO) against the existing NVMe-present setup:
    ```
    msc: registered as tertiary block_dev (slot 1, 16384 LBAs x 512B; NVMe primary)
    msc: slot 1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
    Tertiary registration: USB MS callable via direct `msc_*_lba` but NVMe stays `blk_active`. READ(10) demo against the 8 MB blank stick returns first 8 bytes = zeros (matches blank backing file).

2. **`MSC_RW_DEMO=1` build** — adds the write round-trip:
    ```
    msc: LBA100 write-then-read round-trip PASS
    ```
    First AGNOS-issued USB Mass Storage write to land on emulated media. Verified via byte-exact readback through the same SCSI BBB pipeline. **This is the canary that proves bidirectional data-phase bulk I/O on real silicon will land cleanly once the iron audit is satisfied.**

**Phase 1-4 build trajectory** (1.31.2 `[Unreleased]`):

| Cut | Size | Δ |
|---|---|---|
| AHCI carry-forward HEAD (Phase 0) | 474,600 B | baseline |
| + USB MS Phase 1 (discovery)      | 478,440 B | +3,840 B |
| + USB MS Phase 2 (BBB transport + TUR) | 484,992 B | +6,552 B |
| + USB MS Phase 3 (INQUIRY + READ CAPACITY) | 488,984 B | +3,992 B |
| + USB MS Phase 4 (READ/WRITE/register/demo) | **493,688 B** | +4,696 B |

**Total USB MS arc cost: +19,088 B / +4.0% kernel growth** for ~990 LOC across `msc.cyr` (~890 LOC) + `xhci_ctx.cyr` (+70 LOC for `add_bulk_pair`) + `block.cyr` (BLK_USB_MS dispatch arms + register fn) + main.cyr wiring + aarch64 stubs.

**Iron validation gate**: pre-burn audit `agnosticos/docs/development/usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` lands alongside this cycle. Iron burns batch the full Phase 1-4 stack (USB stick on archaemenid → enumerate as MSC-BBB device → register as tertiary alongside NVMe Crucial P3 + SATA WD Blue SA510 → READ(10) LBA-0 readback as smoke); Phase 5 (optical via SCSI MMC, 2048-B sectors) follows.

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (+~240 LOC for the workload + register + demos), `kernel/core/block.cyr` (+`blk_register_usb_ms` + dispatch arms), `kernel/core/main.cyr` (`msc_register_block_dev()` + `msc_read_demo()` + gated `msc_write_demo()` wired post-AHCI / pre-GPT), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (matching stubs for all Phase 4 entry points), `scripts/build.sh` (`MSC_RW_DEMO=1` honored).

### USB Mass Storage iron debut — Attempt 83 on archaemenid (PARTIAL — real-vendor USB 2.0 stick enumerated through Phase 1 + EP-configure; Phase 2 TUR returns NOT_READY and existing TUR-pass gate stops Phase 3 INQUIRY/RC10/tertiary registration)

Third iron-validated storage-class debut of the 1.31.x storage arc, first iron burn of the USB Mass Storage stack. A real-vendor USB 2.0 flash drive (VID `0x0936` PID `0x13E8`, generic OEM) was plugged into archaemenid's USB-A port; xhci enumerated it on port 3 at HS speed, addressed it as slot 2, and MSC Phase 1 + Phase 2's Configure-Endpoint step both lit up clean first iron try. The Phase 2 TEST UNIT READY round-trip returned `bCSWStatus != 0` ("Command Failed") — the spec-anticipated cold-insertion NOT_READY response that QEMU's `usb-storage` emulator never reproduces (pre-burn audit `usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` § 3 hypothesis 2 explicitly anticipated this shape). The existing code at `msc.cyr:317-381` gates Phase 3 (INQUIRY + RC10) and Phase 4 (block-layer registration + LBA-0 readback) behind a TUR-pass branch — when TUR failed the entire post-TUR success path was skipped. Boot continued cleanly through NVMe / AHCI / GPT / VFS / kybernet / shell.

**Build under test:**

| Component | Version | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `agnos` | **1.31.2 `[Unreleased]` HEAD** (~492,992 B default; ~493,688 B with `MSC_RW_DEMO=1`) | USB MS Phase 1-4 + AHCI carry-forward triplet + cycc 6.0.1 pin graduation all live. Default build used. |
| `gnoboot` | 0.4.2 (unchanged from Attempts 78/80/81/82) | Sovereign UEFI handoff, banner only. |
| `cyrius` | 6.0.1 toolchain; kernel pin 6.0.1 | Second iron burn of agnos on the v6.0.x toolchain (Attempt 82 was the first). |

**Iron evidence shape — confirms real silicon, not QEMU emulation:**

| Field | Iron value | Reading |
|---|---|---|
| xhci port | 3 | physical USB-A on archaemenid (HS = USB 2.0; QEMU defaults to SS) |
| VID | `2358` = `0x0936` | generic OEM USB-stick VID (not Iomega `0x059B` / SanDisk `0x0781` / Apacer `0x0EA0`) |
| PID | `5096` = `0x13E8` | generic OEM PID; distinct from QEMU's `0x0001` |
| `bDeviceClass` | 0x00 | "interface-defined" — class lives on the Interface Descriptor (standard MSC shape) |
| BBB interface | intf=0 | MSC class triple (0x08/0x06/0x50) matched on Interface 0 |
| Bulk EP IN | `0x82` (EP2 IN) | distinct from QEMU's `0x81` |
| Bulk EP OUT | `0x01` (EP1 OUT) | distinct from QEMU's `0x02` |
| Bulk MPS | 512 each direction | HS bulk MPS (USB 2.0 max); QEMU at SS gives 1024 |
| MaxLUN | 0 | single-LUN stick |

**Boot output — MSC moments + onward** (photo: `iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-83-usb-ms-iron-debut.jpg` in agnosticos):

```

hid: keyboard configured, boot protocol on, EP=129, polling 8-byte reports
msc: slot 2 BBB intf=0 bulk-IN=130 bulk-OUT=1 MPS(in/out)=512/512 MaxLUN=0

msc: 1 mass-storage device(s) detected

...(NVMe + AHCI + GPT + shell as Attempt 82 baseline)
```

**What this validates on iron beyond QEMU:**

- xHCI port-reset / address / Configure Endpoint on a **real-vendor USB 2.0 device** — second xHCI slot occupant on real silicon (slot 1 = HID kbd).
- Configuration Descriptor walker (`xhci_find_msc_bbb_endpoints`) correctly classifies a real-vendor interface as MSC-BBB (class 0x08 / subclass 0x06 / protocol 0x50) and captures the bulk EP pair at a non-QEMU layout (EP `0x82` / `0x01` vs QEMU's `0x81` / `0x02`).
- `xhci_input_ctx_add_bulk_pair` + Configure Endpoint command landed against AMD FCH xHCI first try (no Phase-2 init failure log printed → CMOS kcp `0x53` would stamp).
- CBW transport reached the device on real silicon: the eventual `CSW status != 0` print means the device received the SCSI TEST UNIT READY opcode, processed it, formed a CSW, and DMA'd it back through the bulk-IN ring. The transport layer is structurally working — the device's response (NOT_READY) is a SCSI-semantic state, not a transport bug.

**What this does NOT yet validate on iron (deferred to next-touch):**

- INQUIRY round-trip (SPC-4 §6.6) — currently gated behind TUR pass.
- READ CAPACITY(10) round-trip (SBC-3 §5.10) — currently gated behind TUR pass.
- READ(10) / WRITE(10) workload path on real silicon.
- Tertiary block-layer registration (`msc: registered as tertiary block_dev`).
- LBA-0 readback via `msc_read_demo`.

**Post-burn code-read finding — failure is transport-layer, not SCSI-semantic:**

The print `TEST UNIT READY -> not ready / failed (CSW status != 0)` is misleading. Reading `msc.cyr` line-by-line shows it's the generic else-branch label in `msc_probe_slot:377-380` — it fires for ANY non-zero return from `msc_test_unit_ready`. The two prior xhci/msc timeout lines come from `msc_bbb_exec:659-663` — **Step 4 CSW receive on bulk-IN timed out**; the device never DMA'd a CSW. `transport_failed` sticky (`row + 69`) is SET. The audit's § 3 hypothesis 2 prediction (NOT_READY with `bCSWStatus=1`, sense `02/04/01`) is **unverified, not confirmed** — no CSW was ever decoded.

This promotes Reset Recovery (USB MSC BBB §6.7.3) from "deferred to Phase 5" to the **primary** Phase 2.5 fix.

**Carry-forward — Phase 2.5 (four-patch device-side stack):**

Single-burn fix per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` (Linux `drivers/usb/storage/transport.c` § `usb_stor_Bulk_reset` + `usb_stor_clear_halt` + `drivers/usb/storage/usb.c` § `usb_stor_TUR` + `drivers/scsi/sd.c` § `sd_spinup_disk` + USB MSC BBB §6.7.3 + SPC-4 §6.27 references — no letter ladder):

1. **`msc_reset_recovery` helper** (PRIMARY — USB MSC BBB §6.7.3). Three control requests via `xhci_control_no_data`: Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset (`0x21/0xFF/0/intf/0`) + CLEAR_FEATURE(ENDPOINT_HALT) on bulk-IN (`0x02/0x01/0/ep_in_addr/0`) + same on bulk-OUT. Plus host-side: re-zero both bulk rings, rewrite Link TRBs, reset cycle/idx state in the per-slot row, clear `transport_failed` sticky. Without this, retries reissue against wedged rings.
2. **TUR retry loop**. Wrap `msc_test_unit_ready` in 3-try loop in `msc_probe_slot`; between failed attempts call `msc_reset_recovery` when `transport_failed=1`; small spin-count delay (~5M iterations ≈ 5–10ms wall) between tries. Matches Linux's `usb_stor_TUR` + `sd_spinup_disk` retry pattern.
3. **Hoist INQUIRY out of the TUR-pass gate**. Per SPC-4 §6.6, INQUIRY does not require the LUN to be Ready; the audit anticipated this code shape but the implementation gates Phase 3 entirely behind TUR. Move `msc_inquiry` to run unconditionally after `msc_configure_endpoints` success; keep `msc_read_capacity` inside the TUR-pass branch (RC10 legitimately requires Ready per SBC-3 §5.10). Even if all TUR retries exhaust, INQUIRY may succeed — vendor/product/PDT recovery is independent of LUN ready state.
4. **`msc_request_sense` helper** (SPC-4 §6.27). 6-byte CDB + 18-byte response. Decode sense key (low nibble of byte 2) + ASC (byte 12) + ASCQ (byte 13). Print one-line diagnostic on TUR failure. Distinguishes "becoming ready" (02/04/01 → retry) / "no medium" (02/3A/00 → still register if INQUIRY worked) / "media changed" (02/28/00 → re-init); surfaces unexpected codes for inspection. Critical for seeing what the device actually reports once Reset Recovery unsticks the transport.

**Held for Phase 2.6 (only if Phase 2.5 iron evidence shows it's needed):**

- Controller-side EP recovery (xHCI Reset Endpoint TRB type 14 + Set TR Dequeue Pointer TRB type 16 + Stop Endpoint TRB type 15 per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.8 / §4.6.9 / §4.6.10). If Phase 2.5's device-only recovery doesn't unstick iron (e.g., `xhci: transfer event timeout` repeats on the retried CBW), Phase 2.6 adds the xHCI command surface to `xhci_cmd.cyr`.
- READ CAPACITY(16) fallback for > 2 TiB devices — Phase 5 / SBC-3 §5.11.
- Phase 5 optical (SCSI MMC, 2048-B sectors) — first non-512-B device on AGNOS; separate audit, HP external USB Blu-ray on archaemenid is the iron target.

**Status against the audit's success rubric (`usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` § 5):**

- **Full success rubric:** missed by ~5 lines — the entire post-TUR success suite (INQUIRY decode + RC10 + tertiary registration + LBA0 readback) sits behind the TUR-pass gate that didn't open.
- **Partial — vendor-specific quirk:** matches *exactly* hypothesis 2 of § 3 (NOT_READY on cold insertion of removable media). Surfaces an additional code-vs-audit gap (TUR gate stops Phase 3, not just RC10).
- **Failure rubric:** not triggered — no xhci enumeration hang, no Configure Endpoint timeout, no kernel fault, boot walked through to AGNOS shell.

**Files changed:** None this commit. Next-touch will modify `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (TUR retry helper + Phase 3 hoist + REQUEST SENSE decode + sense-data-aware retry plumbing).

Detail in [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 83](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md). State.md storage-targets row 3a + new § USB MS iron carry-forward subsection record the cross-repo state.

### USB Mass Storage Phase 2.5 — Reset Recovery + TUR retry + INQUIRY hoist + REQUEST SENSE (post-Attempt-83 carry-forward)

Closes the four-patch device-side carry-forward stack from the Attempt 83 PASS-WITH-CAVEAT — the burn that surfaced Step 4 CSW receive timeouts wedging the bulk transport on real-vendor USB sticks before any post-TUR Phase 3 / Phase 4 work could land. Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` (Linux `drivers/usb/storage/transport.c` § `usb_stor_Bulk_reset` + `usb_stor_clear_halt` + `drivers/usb/storage/usb.c` § `usb_stor_TUR` + `drivers/scsi/sd.c` § `sd_spinup_disk` references); USB MSC BBB §6.7.3 + SPC-4 §6.6 + §6.27 + SBC-3 §5.10 the spec references. Single-burn fix shape — no letter ladder.

- **`msc_reset_recovery(slot_id)` — new function in `msc.cyr` after `msc_bbb_exec`.** USB MSC BBB §6.7.3 three-step sequence: Bulk-Only Mass Storage Reset class control (`0x21 / 0xFF / 0 / intf / 0`) via `xhci_control_no_data`, then CLEAR_FEATURE(ENDPOINT_HALT) on bulk-IN (`0x02 / 0x01 / 0 / ep_in_addr / 0`), then same on bulk-OUT. Plus host-side rewind: re-zero both bulk-ring pages via `xhci_zero_page`, rewrite the Link TRBs at the last slot of each ring (xHCI 1.2 §6.4.4.1, TC=1 + cycle=1), reset per-slot row state (`bulk_in_cycle` / `bulk_out_cycle` → 1, `bulk_in_idx` / `bulk_out_idx` → 0), clear `transport_failed` sticky byte at `row + 69`. Returns 1 on full success, 0 if any of the three control requests fails. Prints `msc: slot N Reset Recovery OK` on success or a specific `... failed` line for whichever step bailed.

  **Held for Phase 2.6 if iron evidence requires it**: controller-side EP recovery (xHCI Reset Endpoint TRB type 14 / Set TR Dequeue Pointer TRB type 16 / Stop Endpoint TRB type 15 per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.8 / §4.6.9 / §4.6.10). The device-only recovery shipped here may not fully unstick a controller with a wedged TR Dequeue Pointer; if Attempt 84 shows `xhci: transfer event timeout` repeating after Reset Recovery, Phase 2.6 adds the xHCI command-level surface to `xhci_cmd.cyr`.

- **TUR retry loop in `msc_probe_slot` (3 tries with Reset Recovery between failed attempts).** Wraps `msc_test_unit_ready` in `while (tries < 3) { ... }`; if `transport_failed=1` after a failed call, runs `msc_reset_recovery` before the next attempt; if Reset Recovery itself fails, breaks out. Inter-retry delay is a small spin loop (~5M iterations ≈ 5–10 ms wall on Zen-class silicon, matching AHCI's quiescence-poll magnitude). Matches Linux's `usb_stor_TUR` retry pattern + `sd_spinup_disk` shape for "becoming ready" cases that take a few ms to clear.

- **INQUIRY hoisted out of TUR-pass gate.** Per SPC-4 §6.6, Standard INQUIRY does NOT require the LUN to be in Ready state — the audit anticipated this and asserted "Current Phase 2 behavior: prints ... and continues to attempt Phase 3 INQUIRY anyway" but the previous implementation gated all of Phase 3 + Phase 4 behind a TUR-pass branch (the audit/code gap surfaced at Attempt 83). `msc_inquiry` now runs unconditionally after `msc_configure_endpoints` succeeds; vendor / product / revision / PDT decode is recovered even when TUR ultimately fails. `msc_read_capacity` stays inside the TUR-pass branch because RC10 legitimately requires Ready state per SBC-3 §5.10.

- **`msc_request_sense(slot_id, lun)` — new function in `msc.cyr` between `msc_read_capacity` and the Phase 3 print helpers.** SPC-4 §6.27 — 6-byte CDB (opcode `0x03`, DESC=0 fixed-format, allocation length 18, control 0), 18-byte fixed-format response. Decodes sense key (low nibble byte 2), ASC (byte 12), ASCQ (byte 13) from the response and prints a one-line diagnostic: `msc: slot N sense key=K ASC=A ASCQ=Q [label]`. Common SPC-4 Annex D shapes get a short textual label inline: `02/04/01` → "becoming ready", `02/3A/xx` → "medium not present", `06/28/xx` → "media may have changed", `06/29/xx` → "power-on / reset", `00/xx/xx` → "no sense". Called once after all TUR retries are exhausted — gives iron-log evidence of *why* the device says it's not ready. (If transport is still wedged after Reset Recovery, REQUEST SENSE itself will timeout in `msc_bbb_exec` Step 4 — that's also useful iron evidence, pointing at Phase 2.6's controller-side recovery.)

**Boot-output shape change** (vs the previous Attempt-83 capture):

| Path | Previous boot output | Phase 2.5 boot output |
|---|---|---|
| MSC-BBB device enumerated | `msc: slot N BBB intf=... bulk-IN=... bulk-OUT=... MPS(in/out)=... MaxLUN=0` | unchanged |
| Phase 3 INQUIRY | (only after TUR Pass) `msc: slot N INQUIRY: vendor='...' product='...' rev='...' type=block` | (always, after Configure Endpoint) — same |
| Phase 2 TUR retry — transport-wedged path | (none — went straight to fail) | `msc: slot N transport wedged, attempting Reset Recovery` → `msc: slot N Reset Recovery OK` → retry |
| Phase 2 TUR Pass | `msc: slot N TEST UNIT READY -> ready (Pass)` | unchanged |
| Phase 2 TUR exhausted | `msc: slot N TEST UNIT READY -> not ready / failed (CSW status != 0)` (misleading label) | `msc: slot N TEST UNIT READY -> not ready after 3 retries` + `msc: slot N sense key=K ASC=A ASCQ=Q [label]` |
| Phase 3 RC10 | (only after TUR Pass) `msc: slot N READ CAPACITY: last_lba=... blk=...B -> ... MiB` | (only after TUR Pass — RC10 legitimately requires Ready) — same |

**QEMU validation** — re-ran the existing `-device qemu-xhci -device usb-storage,bus=xhci.0,drive=stick` harness. QEMU's emulated `usb-storage` returns TUR Pass on first try → retry loop short-circuits → boot output matches the pre-Phase-2.5 success path:

```
msc: slot 1 BBB intf=0 bulk-IN=129 bulk-OUT=2 MPS(in/out)=1024/1024 MaxLUN=0
msc: slot 1 INQUIRY: vendor='QEMU' product='QEMU HARDDISK' rev='2.5+' type=block
msc: slot 1 TEST UNIT READY -> ready (Pass)
msc: slot 1 READ CAPACITY: last_lba=16383 blk=512B -> 8 MiB
msc: registered as tertiary block_dev (slot 1, 16384 LBAs x 512B; NVMe primary)
msc: slot 1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
msc: 1 mass-storage device(s) detected
```

The retry / Reset Recovery / REQUEST SENSE paths are unexercised by QEMU (which always reports Ready); their iron validation lands at Attempt 84.

**Build**: 492,992 B (default 1.31.2 `[Unreleased]` post-Attempt-83 HEAD) → **496,656 B** (+3,664 B for the Phase 2.5 stack: ~85 LOC `msc_reset_recovery` + ~75 LOC `msc_request_sense` + ~60 LOC re-shaped `msc_probe_slot` body + aarch64 stubs).

**Files changed:** `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/msc.cyr` (+`msc_reset_recovery` after `msc_bbb_exec`; +`msc_request_sense` between `msc_read_capacity` and Phase 3 print helpers; re-shaped Phase 2/3 block in `msc_probe_slot` — INQUIRY hoisted, TUR retry loop with Reset Recovery, REQUEST SENSE call after exhausted retries), `kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` (+`msc_reset_recovery` + `msc_request_sense` stubs).

**Iron-validation gate for Attempt 84**: install on archaemenid, plug the same USB 2.0 stick used at Attempt 83 (or any real-vendor USB stick), observe whether (a) Reset Recovery unwedges the bulk transport (`msc: slot N Reset Recovery OK` followed by a Pass on retry 2 or 3), or (b) the device-only recovery isn't enough (`xhci: transfer event timeout` repeats, REQUEST SENSE also times out) — which would surface Phase 2.6 as the next-touch. Either outcome is iron-actionable. Pre-burn audit refresh queued for `usb-ms-iron-burn-audit.md` § 7+ (Phase 2.5 success rubric).

### 1.31.2 cycle status — Phase 2.7 built, Attempt 86 burn pending

Current `[Unreleased]` work since 1.31.1 cut (the AHCI carry-forward + USB MS Phase 1 through Phase 2.7 + cyrius pin graduation) builds clean. **Closing 1.31.2 is gated on Attempt 86 iron evidence** (the Phase 2.7 burn) — only after iron reports does the user decide whether to ship 1.31.2 as-is, fold Attempt 86 result into the close, or extend with another phase.

Iron trajectory so far in 1.31.2 `[Unreleased]`: Attempt 82 (AHCI carry-forward + cyrius 6.0.1 debut PASS) → Attempt 83 (USB MS debut PARTIAL — TUR-gate gap) → Attempt 84 (Phase 2.5 PARTIAL — device-side recovery executes clean; controller-side justified) → Attempt 85 (Phase 2.6 FALSIFIED — Reset Endpoint CSE; multi-source audit triggered) → Phase 2.7 lands in source + build. **Attempt 86 not yet burned.**

## [1.31.1] — 2026-05-20 (Storage cycle continuation — GPT Phase 1-3 + AHCI/SATA Phase 1-4 driver + iron debut on WD Blue SA510 SATA SSD)

### GPT Phase 1 (header probe + decode + first-4KB partition array walk)

First engineering cut of the 1.31.1 storage-arc continuation. New `kernel/core/gpt.cyr` (~180 LOC) consumes the existing block-dispatch layer (`blk_read` / `blk_read_sectors`) to parse a GUID Partition Table at LBA 1. Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`, UEFI § 5.3.2 + Linux's `block/partitions/efi.c` are the structural references — port the shape, redesign to Cyrius conventions.

**What it does:**
- `gpt_init()` — main entry, wired into `main.cyr` after `nvme_register_block_dev()` and before `vfs_init()`. No-op if `blk_active == 0`, LBA 1 read fails, or signature check fails (typical on unpartitioned disks — e.g., archaemenid's NVMe at iron debut, where LBA 0 = all zeros).
- `gpt_validate_signature(buf)` — checks 8-byte `"EFI PART"` signature at offset 0, encoded as two little-endian u32 loads (`GPT_SIG_LO = 0x20494645` "EFI ", `GPT_SIG_HI = 0x54524150` "PART") rather than a single load64 — mirrors nvme.cyr's "avoid load64 on MMIO" reflex applied to the read-scratch surface.
- `gpt_decode_header(buf)` — extracts FirstUsableLBA (offset 40), LastUsableLBA (48), DiskGUID (56, cached as two u64 halves), PartitionEntryLBA (72), NumberOfPartitionEntries (80), SizeOfPartitionEntry (84) into module globals.
- `gpt_walk_first_4kb()` — reads first 4 KB of the partition entry array via `blk_read_sectors(arr_lba, 8, buf)`, walks up to 32 entries (standard 128 B entry size), counts non-empty ones (first-8-bytes-of-TypeGUID != 0).
- `gpt_print_summary()` — single-line `gpt: present, first=N last=N parts=N/N` log.

**What it does NOT do (Phase 2 territory):**
- Full 16 KB partition array walk — caps at 32 entries (first 4 KB) even when `num_partition_entries > 32`.
- GPT CRC32 validation — header_crc32 + partition_array_crc32 decoded into globals but not verified against computed CRC32.
- Backup-header recovery on primary failure — alt_lba field read but never followed.
- Partition-aware addressing helpers (`gpt_partition_start(idx)` / `gpt_partition_size(idx)` / `gpt_partition_type(idx)`).
- `parts` shell command.
- Hex-print of disk / type / unique GUIDs.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x49` (header signature valid + decoded), `kcp=0x4A` (partition array first 4 KB walked). Continues NVMe's 0x40-0x48 sequence in CMOS slot 0x50.

**QEMU validation:** 32 MB `nvme0.img` formatted with `parted -s nvme0.img mklabel gpt mkpart data 1MiB 16MiB mkpart scratch 16MiB 100%` — two partitions ("data" + "scratch"). agnos boot through QEMU (gnoboot 0.4.2 + OVMF + `-cpu max` + `-device nvme,drive=nvme0,serial=AGN001`):

```
nvme: ns1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 65536 LBAs x 512B)
gpt: present, first=34 last=65502 parts=2/128
VFS initialized
...
AGNOS shell v1.31.1 (type 'help')
```

`first=34` = standard 4 KB partition array offset (LBA 2 + 32 array LBAs); `last=65502` = 32 MB disk - 1 MB GPT overhead; `parts=2/128` = our two parted partitions, of 128 reserved entries. Header decode confirmed against the parted-generated GPT.

**No-op-on-blank-disk smoke** continues to pass: when no GPT is present (LBA 1 is all zeros), `gpt_validate_signature` returns 0 and `gpt_init` early-exits silently. Verified on the no-NVMe (virtio-blk-only) QEMU smoke path indirectly via the absence of a `gpt:` line.

**Out of scope:** Iron burn — Phase 1 is pure read-only; no behavioral path lands new on iron until either (a) archaemenid's NVMe gets formatted with GPT (user action), or (b) AHCI/SATA Phase 1 lands and `sda` becomes addressable. Phase 2's `parts` shell command + partition-aware helpers will fold into the same `[Unreleased]` window before 1.31.1 ships.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 441,056 B (1.31.0 NVMe Phase 5) → **441,176 B** (+120 B for the gpt.cyr module — small because the partition array walker is a tight loop with minimal DCE-surviving code). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

### GPT Phase 2 (full 16 KB array walk + name extraction + `parts` shell command + partition-aware helpers)

Second engineering cut of GPT — extends `kernel/core/gpt.cyr` with the full 128-entry array walk (was capped at first 4 KB / 32 entries in Phase 1), UTF-16LE partition-name extraction, boot-time partition table dump, the consumer-facing `parts` shell command, and partition-aware helpers for downstream consumers (ext2 / agnos-boot lookup / future formatter tooling).

**What it does:**
- **`gpt_walk_all_partitions()`** (replaces Phase 1's `gpt_walk_first_4kb`) — loops 4 × 4 KB chunks of the partition entry array via `blk_read_sectors(arr_lba + chunk*8, 8, gpt_array_buf)`, walks each chunk's entries, counts non-empty ones. Standard layout is 128 entries × 128 B = 16 KB; non-standard `partition_entry_size` is honored (entries_per_chunk = 4096 / entry_size). Re-reads per chunk because `pmm_alloc` returns single 4 KB pages — no contiguous-multi-page allocator in the kernel yet, so the natural shape is iterate-and-overwrite.
- **`gpt_print_name(name_ptr)`** — UTF-16LE name decoder. Names are 72-byte (36-char-max) UTF-16LE strings at offset 56 of each entry. For the typical ASCII-named partition, the low byte of each u16 is the printable char; `kprint(name_ptr + i*2, 1)` writes one byte directly. Non-ASCII chars (high byte ≠ 0) print as their low-byte glyph — garbled but never breaks surrounding output. Stops at the first u16 = 0.
- **`gpt_print_all_partitions()`** — multi-line table print: header line shows active/reserved counts, one indented line per non-empty entry showing `[idx] <name>  LBA <first>-<last> (<size> MiB)`. Size in MiB derived from `(sectors * blk_lba_bytes) / 1048576`, so a non-512-B-LBA drive (4 K-native NVMe, eventually) reports correctly. Called from main.cyr at boot when `gpt_init() == 1`, and on demand via the `parts` shell command.
- **`gpt_partition_info(idx)`** — partition-aware helper. Computes which 4 KB chunk contains `idx`, reads it, decodes type GUID (16 B) + first_lba (8) + last_lba (8) into 5 query globals (`gpt_q_type_lo` / `gpt_q_type_hi` / `gpt_q_first_lba` / `gpt_q_last_lba` / `gpt_q_sectors`). Returns 1 on success, 0 if idx out of range / read failure / empty entry. One 4 KB read per call — callers querying multiple fields of the same partition batch through this single function rather than calling separate getters.
- **`parts` shell command** — new entry in `kernel/user/shell.cyr`'s command dispatch, wired into the help listing. Calls `gpt_print_all_partitions()`. Prints `no GPT` when `gpt_present == 0`. Re-reads the array on each invocation (no caching) — one `parts` = 4 × 4 KB reads, fine for an infrequent command.

**What it does NOT do (Phase 3 territory):**
- **GPT CRC32 validation** — header_crc32 and partition_array_crc32 fields decoded but not verified against computed CRC32. Phase 3 will add a table-driven CRC32 (256-entry polynomial table, standard 0xEDB88320) and a `gpt_verify_crcs()` gate. Phase 2 currently trusts the disk's GPT regardless of CRC state — fine for the bring-up window, not for trust-grade production.
- **Backup-header recovery** — alt_lba field decoded but never followed; primary-header-only path. Phase 3 will probe alt_lba on primary-header CRC failure.
- **Partition-type-GUID classification** — `gpt_q_type_lo` / `gpt_q_type_hi` returned by `gpt_partition_info` but no helper to map common GUIDs to human-readable names ("Linux filesystem" / "EFI System" / etc.). Phase 3 or downstream consumers (ext2-mount, agnos-boot-lookup) will own the type table.

**Boot-time auto-print rationale.** The `parts` command alone would require keyboard injection for QEMU validation — workable but adds harness complexity. Adding a single `gpt_print_all_partitions()` call in `main.cyr` after `gpt_init() == 1` gives the same partition-table-on-iron output on every boot, costs one extra 16 KB of disk reads (microseconds), and matches the existing NVMe pattern (`nvme: ns1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: ...` boot-time receipt). Will gate behind a `STORAGE_VERBOSE` env if it becomes noisy in production; for the bring-up window, keep it visible.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x4A` semantics widened from "first 4 KB walked" (Phase 1) to "full partition array walked" (Phase 2). Same slot, same value — no new kcp needed; Phase 1 + Phase 2 cleared the gate identically.

**QEMU validation:** 64 MB `nvme0.img` formatted with `parted -s nvme0.img mklabel gpt mkpart agnos-boot fat32 1MiB 16MiB mkpart user-data ext4 16MiB 40MiB mkpart scratch linux-swap 40MiB 56MiB mkpart reserved 56MiB 100%` — four parted partitions with varied names + sizes:

```
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 131072 LBAs x 512B)
gpt: present, first=34 last=131038 parts=4/128
partitions (4 active / 128 reserved):
  [0] agnos-boot  LBA 2048-32767 (15 MiB)
  [1] user-data  LBA 32768-81919 (24 MiB)
  [2] scratch  LBA 81920-114687 (16 MiB)
  [3] reserved  LBA 114688-131038 (7 MiB)
VFS initialized
...
AGNOS shell v1.31.1 (type 'help')
```

All four partition names decoded cleanly from UTF-16LE; LBA ranges + MiB sizes match `parted -s nvme0.img print` byte-for-byte (15 / 24 / 16 / 7 MiB matches parted's report). The `parts` shell command path compiled-in but not exercised in this smoke (no keyboard injection); will be exercised on first iron burn once archaemenid's NVMe or SATA surface is GPT-formatted.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 441,176 B (Phase 1) → **443,760 B** (+2,584 B for Phase 2: full walker + name printer + `parts` cmd + partition-aware helpers + boot-time auto-print + aarch64 stubs). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope (iron):** Same as Phase 1 — archaemenid's M.2 NVMe surface is currently blank (no GPT), and the SATA `sda` surface awaits the AHCI driver. First iron exercise of the GPT layer will come either when the user formats the NVMe or when AHCI Phase 1 lands. Phase 3 (CRC32 + backup-header) and AHCI Phase 1 are next bites under this same 1.31.1 cycle.

### AHCI/SATA Phase 1 (HBA probe + CAP/GHC/PI decode + port enumeration)

First engineering cut of the AHCI/SATA driver — opens the second iron-validatable block-device class for the 1.31.1 cycle (archaemenid `sda` 1.8 TB SATA SSD per `project_hardware_catalog`). New `kernel/core/ahci.cyr` (~280 LOC) modeled on NVMe Phase 1's shape; Intel AHCI 1.3.1 spec + Linux's `drivers/ata/libahci.c` `ahci_save_initial_config` is the structural reference per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`.

**What it does:**
- **`ahci_probe()`** — PCI class probe via `pci_find_by_class(0x01, 0x06, 0x01)` (Mass Storage / Serial ATA / AHCI 1.0 — distinct from NVMe's `0x01/0x08/0x02` and from legacy IDE `0x01/0x01/*`), fetches BAR5 (ABAR = AHCI Base — NOT BAR0 like NVMe; AHCI 1.3.1 §2.1.11 mandates BAR5 for the register interface) via `pci_bar_64(idx, 5)`, asserts bus-master, remaps the 2 MB chunk as UC. Reads CAP (offset 0x00) and decodes seven fields we care about for Phase 1: **NP** (Number of Ports, bits 0-4, zero-based), **NCS** (Number of Command Slots, bits 8-12, zero-based), **ISS** (Interface Speed Support, bits 20-23, 1/2/3 = 1.5/3/6 Gbps), **SAM** (Supports AHCI Mode only, bit 18), **SSS** (Supports Staggered Spin-up, bit 27), **SNCQ** (Supports Native Command Queuing, bit 30), **S64A** (Supports 64-bit Addressing, bit 31). Reads GHC (0x04), PI (0x0C, Ports Implemented bitmap), VS (0x10, version). Prints three lines: discovery + capability summary + GHC/PI summary.
- **`ahci_enum_ports()`** — walks the PI bitmap, for each implemented port reads **PxSSTS** (port_offset + 0x28) and **PxSIG** (port_offset + 0x24). Classifies device by signature: `0x00000101` = SATA, `0xEB140101` = ATAPI, `0xC33C0101` = SEMB, `0x96690101` = port multiplier. DET (SSTS bits 0-3) = 3 means "device present + PHY comm established"; DET = 0 means no device; DET = 1 means handshake-incomplete. Counts ports with DET=3 into `ahci_devices_found`.
- **Module state**: `ahci_present`, `ahci_pci_idx`, `ahci_mmio_base`, decoded CAP fields, GHC, PI, VS, `ahci_devices_found`. Public — downstream consumers (Phase 2+ port-init, future formatter tooling) will read these.

**What it does NOT do (Phase 2+ territory):**
- **HBA reset** (GHC.HR=1, poll-clear). Firmware-left-state is what we observe; Phase 1 trusts the UEFI handoff state. Phase 2 will own the explicit reset.
- **AHCI-mode set** (GHC.AE=1 write). Read-only observation of GHC.AE in Phase 1; if AE=0 we'd see it but not write. Q35's ich9-ahci ships with AE=1 from firmware; real iron AHCI controllers usually do too.
- **Per-port command-list + FIS-receive allocation** — Phase 2 will allocate the 32-entry × 32 B command list (1 KB) + 256 B FIS-receive buffer per port, both 1 KB-aligned, set PxCLB/PxCLBU + PxFB/PxFBU.
- **Port spin-up + start** (PxCMD.SUD=1, PxCMD.ST=1). Phase 2.
- **IDENTIFY DEVICE** (ATA cmd 0xEC, 512-byte response with model / serial / firmware / LBA48 capacity). Phase 3.
- **READ DMA EXT / WRITE DMA EXT** (cmds 0x25 / 0x35). Phase 4.
- **Block-layer registration** (`blk_register_ahci(capacity, lba_bytes)`). Comes online when Phase 4 lands — until then, AHCI is enumerated but not addressable through `blk_read` / `blk_write`. NVMe stays the active dispatch backend on systems with both.
- **MSI/MSI-X IRQ-driven completion** — polling-only, per xhci + nvme precedent.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x4B` (HBA probe completed — CAP/GHC/VS decoded), `kcp=0x4C` (port enumeration done). Continues the storage-arc sequence 0x40-0x48 (NVMe) / 0x49-0x4A (GPT) / **0x4B-0x4C (AHCI)** in slot 0x50.

**QEMU validation** — q35's built-in ich9-ahci provides 6 SATA ports. Smoke setup: boot disk on default SATA port (`-drive file=disk.img,format=raw`) + second SATA disk (`-drive file=sata1.img,format=raw`) + separate NVMe via `-device nvme,drive=nvme0` (so both block-device classes light up in one run):

```
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 131072 LBAs x 512B)
ahci: found at 2164801536, version=1.0

AGNOS shell v1.31.1 (type 'help')
```

Decoded values:
- ABAR `0x81080000` = canonical q35 ich9-ahci location.
- Version 1.0 (q35 ich9-ahci is AHCI 1.0; real silicon is typically 1.2-1.3.1).
- NP=6 / NCS=32 / GHC.AE=1 (0x80000000) / PI=0x3F (all 6 ports implemented).
- Port 0 + Port 1 = SATA HDD/SSD (SIG=0x00000101) — both detected with DET=3.
- Port 2 = ATAPI (SIG=0xEB140101) — q35's default virtual CDROM device.
- Port 3-5 = no device (SIG=0xFFFF0101, the QEMU idle-bus marker; DET=0).

ISS=1 (Gen1 1.5 Gbps) is QEMU's emulation floor — real iron will report 3 (Gen3 6 Gbps).

**Boot output ordering** — `ahci: found ... ahci: port N ...` lines print between `nvme: registered as block_dev` and `gpt: present` because AHCI Phase 1 runs immediately after NVMe registration in `main.cyr`, before `gpt_init()`. The GPT layer sees `blk_active=BLK_NVME` (NVMe override stayed in place; AHCI doesn't register until Phase 4 lands), so GPT parses the NVMe disk's partition table — not the SATA disks. The SATA disks are enumerated but not yet addressable through `blk_read`.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 443,760 B (GPT Phase 2) → **447,568 B** (+3,808 B for ahci.cyr module + aarch64 stubs + main.cyr wiring). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope (iron):** AHCI Phase 1 is read-only enumeration; no behavioral path lands new on iron until at least Phase 4 (first DMA-driven LBA read/write). However, an iron burn at any time post-Phase-1 would validate the enumeration on archaemenid's actual SATA SSD — confirms ABAR location, controller version (likely 1.2+), and that `sda` shows up with DET=3 + SIG=SATA + model-and-serial-resolvable-via-IDENTIFY (Phase 3). Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work`, that needs a written audit before scheduling — likely batched with Phase 2-4 once a usable AHCI block backend exists. Phase 2 (HBA reset + per-port command list + FIS receive + port spin-up + start) is the next bite.

### AHCI/SATA Phase 2 (per-port CL+FIS allocation + spin-up + start)

Builds the per-port command-processing infrastructure that Phase 3+ commands ride on. Adds ~250 LOC to `kernel/core/ahci.cyr`: HBA-reset helper (callable but not invoked by default), `ahci_port_init(port)` running the AHCI 1.3.1 §10.1.2 system-software init sequence per port, `ahci_init_all()` driving init across all DET=3 SATA ports.

**What it does:**
- **`ahci_hba_reset()`** — full HBA reset (GHC.AE=1 → GHC.HR=1 → poll-clear → re-assert AE). 1M-iter timeout ceiling. Stamps CMOS kcp `0x4D` on success. NOT called by default — kept callable for Phase 3+ consumers that need a known-state baseline. Default `ahci_init_all` skips reset because gnoboot+UEFI hands off a working PHY state; a reset forces per-port DET=3 re-handshake for no gain at Phase 2.
- **`ahci_port_init(port)`** — full per-port bring-up: clear PxCMD.ST → wait CR=0 → clear PxCMD.FRE → wait FR=0 → allocate 4 KB page each for command list (using 1 KB) + FIS receive area (using 256 B) → zero both → write PxCLB/CLBU + PxFB/FBU → clear PxSERR (W1C) → set PxCMD.FRE=1 → wait FR=1 → set PxCMD.SUD=1 (cold spin-up; no-op if CAP.SSS=0) → wait PxTFD.STS.BSY=0 + DRQ=0 (device ready) → set PxCMD.ST=1 → wait CR=1. Stores per-port CL/FIS phys in module-state arrays (`ahci_port_cl_phys[]` / `ahci_port_fis_phys[]` / `ahci_port_inited[]`, 32 ports max).
- **`ahci_init_all()`** — walks the PI bitmap, calls `ahci_port_init` for every port with DET=3 + SIG=SATA. ATAPI / PM / SEMB ports skipped (different command-set semantics; iron archaemenid has no ATAPI). Defensively re-asserts GHC.AE=1 before the per-port walk. Stamps CMOS kcp `0x4E` after all ports walked. Returns count of successfully initialized ports.

**Build:** 447,568 B → **455,888 B** (+8,320 B for ahci.cyr additions + aarch64 stubs).

**QEMU validation:**
```
ahci: port 0 initialized (CL @ 9326592, FIS @ 9330688)
ahci: port 1 initialized (CL @ 9334784, FIS @ 9338880)
```
Both q35 SATA ports allocated distinct 4 KB pages for CL + FIS (each port's CL+FIS pair are 8 KB apart, satisfying the 1 KB / 256 B alignment requirements trivially from pmm_alloc's 4 KB-aligned returns). ATAPI port 2 + empty ports 3-5 correctly skipped.

### AHCI/SATA Phase 3 (IDENTIFY DEVICE — model / serial / firmware / LBA48 capacity)

First command issued through the Phase 2 CL+FIS infrastructure. Adds ~220 LOC: ATA cmd 0xEC (IDENTIFY DEVICE) — the SATA equivalent of NVMe's IDENTIFY CTRL.

**What it does:**
- **`ahci_identify_device(port)`** — allocates per-port command table (CT, 4 KB page, first 128 B used: 20 B H2D FIS at +0 + 16 B PRDT[0] at +0x80) + 512-byte IDENTIFY data buffer (4 KB page). Builds H2D Register FIS (FIS type 0x27 / C bit / PM port 0 / opcode 0xEC / zero everything else), builds PRDT[0] pointing at the data buffer with DBC=511, builds Command Header in CL slot 0 (CFL=5 H2D-FIS-DWORDs / PRDTL=1 / CTBA=ct_phys / W=0 read). Clears PxIS + PxSERR, writes PxCI bit 0 to issue, polls completion with task-file-ERR escape hatch. Decodes IDENTIFY response: model (offset 54, 40 byte-swapped ASCII), serial (offset 20, 20 byte-swapped ASCII), firmware (offset 46, 8 byte-swapped ASCII), LBA48 sector count (u64 at offset 200). Caches `ahci_id_lba48` / `ahci_id_lba_bytes` (Phase 4 consumes).
- **`ahci_print_id_string(buf, off, len)`** — byte-swap printer (ATA IDENTIFY returns text in word-byte-reversed order per ATA-8 §7.16.7). Each pair printed as low-byte-first via two `kprint(ptr, 1)` calls.
- **`ahci_identify_all()`** — calls IDENTIFY on every initialized port. Stamps CMOS kcp `0x4F` on first successful per-port IDENTIFY.

**Build:** 455,888 B → **463,112 B** (+7,224 B).

**QEMU validation:**
```
ahci: port 0 model='QEMU HARDDISK                           ' serial='QM00001             ' fw='2.5+    '
ahci: port 0 LBA48=131072 sectors (64 MiB)
ahci: port 1 model='QEMU HARDDISK                           ' serial='QM00003             ' fw='2.5+    '
ahci: port 1 LBA48=65536 sectors (32 MiB)
```
Both ports decoded model + serial + firmware as proper ASCII (byte-swap working). LBA48 capacities exactly match the disk.img / sata1.img sizes (64 MB / 32 MB) byte-for-byte.

### AHCI/SATA Phase 4 (READ DMA EXT + WRITE DMA EXT + boot-time RW demo + block-layer registration)

Real disk I/O — closes the AHCI driver as a working block backend. Adds ~370 LOC + extends `kernel/core/block.cyr` with `BLK_AHCI = 3` and `blk_register_ahci()` + AHCI dispatch arms in `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors`.

**What it does:**
- **`ahci_build_rw_fis(ct_phys, opcode, lba, count)`** — builds an H2D Register FIS for READ DMA EXT (0x25) / WRITE DMA EXT (0x35). LBA48 layout: bytes 4-6 hold LBA[23:0], bytes 8-10 hold LBA[47:24], device byte = 0x40 (LBA mode), count in bytes 12-13.
- **`ahci_issue_rw(port, opcode, lba, count, data_phys, is_write)`** — common single-PRDT cmd-issue path factored out of Phase 3's IDENTIFY function. Caps `count` at 128 sectors (64 KB) per call — single-PRDT can address more but 64 KB matches typical max-page-transfer needs and keeps the path simple. Sets CH.W bit when `is_write == 1`. Same task-file-ERR escape + 1M-iter PxCI poll as Phase 3.
- **`ahci_read_lba(port, lba, count, buf)` / `ahci_write_lba(port, lba, count, buf)`** — public READ/WRITE primitives over `ahci_issue_rw`.
- **`ahci_rw_demo()`** — boot-time round-trip validation, mirrors `nvme_rw_demo`: reads LBA 0 (prints first 8 bytes), writes sentinel `"AHCI-OK!"` to LBA 5, reads LBA 5 back into a fresh buffer, verifies byte-by-byte. Single port (lowest-numbered initialized).
- **`ahci_blk_read(sector, buf)` / `ahci_blk_write(sector, buf)` / `ahci_blk_read_sectors(start, count, buf)`** — single-sector + multi-sector wrappers translating the AHCI 1/0 success convention to the block-layer 0/-1 convention. Multi-sector chunks at 128-LBA boundaries through the single-PRDT cap.
- **`ahci_register_block_dev()`** — picks the lowest-numbered initialized port, refreshes capacity via IDENTIFY (since Phase 3's globals only carry the last-called port's data), then **applies policy**: if `blk_active == BLK_NVME`, register as **secondary** (print summary, don't override — NVMe stays primary on multi-disk iron); otherwise call `blk_register_ahci(capacity, 512)` to take the slot (beating virtio paravirt). Stamps CMOS kcp `0x50` on either path.

**block.cyr extension:**
- New `BLK_AHCI = 3` tag.
- New `blk_register_ahci(capacity, lba_bytes)` (unconditional slot assignment; the caller in `ahci_register_block_dev` encodes the override-vs-take policy).
- New AHCI dispatch arms in all three wrappers (`blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors`).

**Build:** 463,112 B → **470,664 B** (+7,552 B).

**QEMU validation:**
```
ahci: port 0 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
ahci: port 0 LBA5 write-then-read round-trip PASS
ahci: port 0 model='QEMU HARDDISK                           ' serial='QM00001             ' fw='2.5+    '
ahci: port 0 LBA48=131072 sectors (64 MiB)
ahci: registered as secondary block_dev (port 0, 131072 LBAs x 512B; NVMe primary)
```
- LBA 0 read: all zeros (matches dd-zeroed disk.img sector 0 — parted didn't write a protective MBR for our partitioning shape; behavior is correct).
- LBA 5 write-then-read: PASS — sentinel `"AHCI-OK!"` (8 bytes) round-tripped through DMA, byte-exact.
- Block-layer registration policy: NVMe present → AHCI registers as **secondary** (logged, but `blk_active` stays BLK_NVME). GPT continues to parse the NVMe partition table (`parts=1/128 [0] nvme-data`); AHCI's disk content is reachable via `ahci_blk_read/write` directly. On a no-NVMe system AHCI would take the slot and downstream consumers (GPT, fatfs, future ext2) would see AHCI transparently.

**CMOS storage-arc sequence at 1.31.1 (full)**: NVMe 0x40-0x48 → GPT 0x49-0x4A → AHCI 0x4B (probe) / 0x4C (port enum) / 0x4D (HBA reset — only when explicitly called) / 0x4E (port init done) / 0x4F (IDENTIFY done) / 0x50 (block-layer registration done). All progressive values in CMOS slot 0x50.

**Out of scope (next bites for 1.31.1 close):**
- **GPT Phase 3** — CRC32 (table-driven 0xEDB88320) header + array validation, backup-header recovery on primary fail, type-GUID classifier ("Linux fs" / "EFI System" / etc.). Correctness hardening; deferrable to a closing 1.31.1 patch.
- **Iron burn on archaemenid** — the `sda` 1.8 TB SATA SSD's first iron exercise. Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` needs a written audit before scheduling; bundles all four AHCI phases at once since they're all read-only against the drive's content except the LBA-5 sentinel write (which is to a location no consumer cares about on archaemenid's drives — but a sentinel write to the wrong physical disk is still a write, so the audit must cover this).

### GPT Phase 3 (CRC32 validation + backup-header recovery + type-GUID classifier)

Closes the GPT layer for the 1.31.1 cycle. Adds ~250 LOC of correctness-hardening over Phase 2: table-less CRC32 (IEEE 802.3 polynomial 0xEDB88320), primary-then-backup header validation, partition-array CRC validation, and a 7-GUID type classifier that prints alongside each partition's name.

**What it does:**
- **`gpt_crc32_init` / `gpt_crc32_chunk` / `gpt_crc32_finalize` / `gpt_crc32`** — streaming + one-shot CRC32 helpers. Table-less inner loop (8 shifts per input byte). Slower than a 256-entry-table version (~8× more ops per byte) but the GPT validates in microseconds on Zen — total work is ~131K inner iterations for header (92 B) + array (16 KB). A table-driven optimization can land in Phase 4 (if any); Phase 3 prioritizes binary size and code clarity.
- **`gpt_validate_header_crc(buf)`** — UEFI § 5.3.2 compliant: zero the HeaderCRC32 field (bytes 16-19) in-place during compute, then restore — saves an allocation for a scratch header copy. HeaderSize validated to spec range [92, 4096] before CRC. Returns 1 on match.
- **`gpt_validate_array_crc()`** — streams CRC across the same 4 × 4 KB chunks Phase 2's walker iterates. Returns 1 on match. Note: leaves chunk 3 in `gpt_array_buf` — `gpt_init` re-primes chunk 0 before the walking pass.
- **Backup-header recovery path** — when `gpt_validate_header_crc` returns 0 on the primary header at LBA 1, `gpt_init` reads `gpt_alt_lba` (decoded from the primary header's offset-32 field), validates the backup's signature + CRC, and if good swaps in the backup's decoded fields. Sets `gpt_using_backup_header = 1`. If both copies fail CRC, `gpt_init` returns 0 — the disk's GPT is unrecoverable and consumers must not trust the field decode.
- **`gpt_print_type(lo, hi)`** — type-GUID classifier covering 7 common partition types: **EFI System** (`C12A7328-F81F-11D2-BA4B-00A0C93EC93B`), **Microsoft Basic Data** (`EBD0A0A2-B9E5-4433-87C0-68B6B72699C7`), **Linux Filesystem** (`0FC63DAF-8483-4772-8E79-3D69D8477DE4`), **Linux Swap** (`0657FD6D-A4AB-43C4-84E5-0933C84B4F4F`), **Linux LVM** (`E6D6D379-F507-44C2-A23C-238F2A3DF928`), **Linux RAID** (`A19D880F-05FC-4D3B-A006-743F0F84911E`), **BIOS Boot** (`21686148-6449-6E6F-744E-656564454649`). GPT's mixed-endian GUID convention (UEFI § 5.3.3) is preserved in the load64 byte-order — the in-source constants are NOT canonical human-readable GUIDs but the byte-order-preserving u64 view of the on-disk layout (each constant's comment shows the canonical form).
- **Trust-posture indicators** — `gpt_print_summary` now appends `hdr-CRC-OK` / `hdr-CRC-BAD`, `arr-CRC-OK` / `arr-CRC-BAD`, and `[backup hdr]` (when recovery fired). Consumers see at-a-glance whether the GPT validated cleanly.
- **`gpt_print_all_partitions`** now prints the classified type before the name (e.g., `[0] EFI System EFI  LBA 2048-16383 (7 MiB)`).

**CMOS checkpoint:** new `kcp=0x51` (GPT CRC validation completed — fires after the validation logic runs, regardless of pass/fail, so iron post-mortem can tell whether the Phase 3 path executed at all). Phase 2's `0x4A` (array walked) still stamps.

**QEMU validation:** 4-partition disk with mixed types (ESP / parted-default-typed Linux root / Linux swap / MSFT-Basic-flagged Windows-style):

```
gpt: present, first=34 last=131038 parts=4/128 hdr-CRC-OK arr-CRC-OK
partitions (4 active / 128 reserved):
  [0] EFI System EFI  LBA 2048-16383 (7 MiB)
  [1] (unknown type) linux-root  LBA 16384-65535 (24 MiB)
  [2] Linux swap swap  LBA 65536-98303 (16 MiB)
  [3] MSFT Basic winshare  LBA 98304-131038 (15 MiB)
```

Both CRCs validate (`hdr-CRC-OK arr-CRC-OK`) — primary header path, no backup recovery exercised in QEMU. Three of four partitions classified correctly: **EFI System** (parted's ESP flag), **Linux swap** (parted's linux-swap fs type), **MSFT Basic** (parted's `ntfs` filesystem hint set the `msftdata` flag → MSFT Basic Data GUID). The `linux-root ext4` partition shows **(unknown type)** because parted doesn't assign the Linux Filesystem type GUID for `ext4` without an explicit `set N` flag — it leaves the type GUID at parted's default. `sgdisk -t N 8300` would set the proper Linux FS GUID and trigger classification. Behavior is correct: the classifier matches on-disk type GUID, not filesystem content.

**Backup-header recovery path** is not exercised in this smoke (primary CRC validates). A negative test would require deliberately corrupting bytes 16-19 of LBA 1 — deferred to a Phase 4 test harness if/when one lands.

**Out of scope (Phase 4+ territory, if any):**
- 256-entry CRC32 table — perf optimization; only matters if GPT validation becomes a measurable boot-time cost.
- Full 16-byte type-GUID match instead of first-8-only — Phase 1's empty-entry check already shortened on the first 8 bytes; tightening to full 16 is symmetric work but not blocking.
- Expanded type-GUID classifier coverage — current 7 entries cover the common-OS spread; specialized GUIDs (ChromeOS, FreeBSD, Solaris, Apple HFS+/APFS, etc.) can land if a consumer needs them.
- `gpt_classify_type(lo, hi) → tag-int` programmatic helper — currently the classifier is print-only; a tag-int variant unblocks consumers that want to act on the classification (e.g., "find the ESP and mount it").

**Build:** 470,664 B (AHCI Phase 4) → **475,096 B** (+4,432 B for gpt.cyr CRC + classifier + Phase 3 wiring in `gpt_init`).

### AHCI/SATA iron debut — Attempt 81 on archaemenid (WD Blue SA510 2.5" 2 TB SATA SSD)

Second iron debut of the 1.31.1 storage arc, same session as the NVMe debut (Attempt 80, recorded under [1.31.0]). Full driver lit up first-iron-try against the real WD Blue SA510 attached to archaemenid's SATA bay — controller bring-up, IDENTIFY decode, AND a real-platter bidirectional DMA round-trip all worked. Partial caveat: a follow-up IDENTIFY in the registration path timed out, and the §4 `AHCI_RW_DEMO` mitigation drafted in the iron-burn audit was deferred for this burn.

**Iron evidence shape (Attempt 81 boot log, abridged):**

**What worked on real silicon:**
- BAR5 at real-PCIe address `0xFCDA0000` (AMD FCH AHCI placement) — UC remap clean.
- AHCI 1.3 spec port spin-up sequence (ST=0 → CR=0 → FRE=0 → FR=0 → CLB/FB program → SERR clear → FRE=1 → FR=1 → SUD=1 → BSY=DRQ=0 → ST=1 → CR=1) completed against firmware-handoff state from gnoboot's UEFI exit.
- ISS=3 (Gen3 6 Gbps) on iron vs ISS=1 (Gen1 1.5 Gbps) in QEMU — first iron-rate validation.
- First IDENTIFY DEVICE returned full 512-byte metadata: model `WD Blue SA510 2.5 2TB`, serial `24313QD00663`, firmware `5304 00WD`, LBA48=3907029168 sectors (≈ 2 TB). ATA byte-swap working on non-QEMU.
- READ DMA EXT (0x25) read LBA 0 returning real disk content (`146 20 0 0 0 111 111 116` — `0x92 0x14 …` followed by ASCII `oot`, likely the tail of a previous Linux install's GRUB-stage1 boot sector).
- **WRITE DMA EXT (0x35) succeeded at LBA 5 with a real DMA payload landing on the platter** — first AGNOS-issued disk write to land on physical silicon. Re-read at LBA 5 byte-identical → bidirectional DMA confirmed.

**What didn't:**
- Second IDENTIFY in `ahci_register_block_dev` (capacity refresh) hung in the PxCI-completion poll → function returned 0 → AHCI did NOT register as secondary block_dev. Boot continued cleanly because GPT/VFS/shell consumers all use `blk_active=BLK_NVME`.

**§4 mitigation deferred for this burn.** Full `ahci_rw_demo` (including the LBA-5 sentinel write) ran against the WD Blue. Per the audit's §3 analysis, LBA 5 sits inside the GPT partition-entry array at entries 12-15 — the WD's partition count is not enumerated here (GPT ran on NVMe per the dispatch policy), so the sentinel either replaced empty entries with garbage (recoverable via `sgdisk --load-backup` from the disk's tail backup array) or destroyed up to 4 real entries (same recovery path). **Partition DATA (LBA 34+) was not touched.** The `AHCI_RW_DEMO` compile gate moves to 1.31.2 scope.

**ATA-string trailing-space drag** is visible in the log above: model / serial / firmware fields print with trailing whitespace because `ahci_print_id_string` doesn't right-trim. ATA8-ACS § 7.16.7 fixes those fields as space-padded fixed-width; Linux's `ata_id_c_string` (libata-core.c) right-trims. Patch deferred to 1.31.2 scope alongside the IDENTIFY-timeout investigation.

**Status against the iron-burn audit's success rubric (`ahci-iron-burn-audit.md` § 7):** PASS-WITH-CAVEAT — matches the "Partial — vendor-specific quirk" path (AMD FCH AHCI + WD SA510 combination exposed a state-reset gap absent from q35 ich9-ahci); does NOT match the "Failure" path (no hang, no triple-fault, kernel walked to shell). The "Full success" rubric was missed by a single line — the post-write IDENTIFY timeout means "no new diagnostic letters or hypotheses needed" isn't cleared.

**Contrast with the xHCI arc** continues to compound: AHCI ported from Linux's `libahci.c` to Cyrius conventions per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` lit up first-iron-try (modulo the post-RW IDENTIFY hang). xHCI took 5 weeks / 19 iron attempts / 9 letter codes before clearing on the same iron — the consultation-not-first-principles posture remains the operational difference.

### 1.31.1 cycle close

All planned engineering phases (GPT 1-3, AHCI/SATA 1-4) landed + both iron debuts (NVMe under [1.31.0], AHCI under this tag) closed in a single session 2026-05-20. Two follow-up surfaces (`post-RW IDENTIFY hang`, ATA-string right-trim) plus one deferred mitigation (`AHCI_RW_DEMO` compile gate) carry forward into **1.31.2**, which opens with USB Mass Storage as primary scope. **1.31.3** continues to slot ext2 read-only.

**Build trajectory through 1.31.1:** 441,056 B (1.31.0 NVMe Phase 5 baseline) → 441,176 B (GPT P1) → 443,760 B (GPT P2) → 447,568 B (AHCI P1) → 455,888 B (AHCI P2) → 463,112 B (AHCI P3) → 470,664 B (AHCI P4) → **475,096 B** (GPT P3). Total cycle delta **+34,040 B / +7.7%** for two new device-class drivers + complete GPT layer + ~1,700 LOC engineering.

## [1.31.0] — 2026-05-20 (NVMe arc — Phase 1-5 driver + block-layer dispatch + iron debut on Crucial P3 2TB; cycle-open production-lean — KTEST + XHCI_VERBOSE compile gates + FB-absent guard + `docs/development/build.md`)

### NVMe Phase 1 (probe + capability decode + controller disable)

First engineering cut of the 1.31.x storage arc. New `kernel/core/nvme.cyr` (~230 LOC) modeled on `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr` Phase 1 — per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`, Linux's `drivers/nvme/host/pci.c` `nvme_disable_ctrl` + `nvme_wait_ready` path is the reference impl.

**What it does:**
- `nvme_probe()` — `pci_find_by_class(0x01, 0x08, 0x02)` (NVM Express triple), `pci_bar0_64` → MMIO base, `pci_enable_bus_master_idx`, `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` (BAR needs UC, not WB). Reads `CAP[63:0]` as two 32-bit halves and `VS[31:0]`, decodes MQES / DSTRD / TO / CSS_NVM / MPSMIN / MPSMAX / version triple, prints a two-line summary.
- `nvme_disable()` — if `CC.EN=1` clear it, write back, poll `CSTS.RDY=0` (1M-iter safety ceiling; QEMU NVMe reaches RDY=0 in tens of iterations).
- Wired into `main.cyr` after `virtio_blk_init`. Graceful no-op when no NVMe device is present.

**What it does NOT do:** Admin queue (AQA / ASQ / ACQ programming), `CC.EN=1` re-enable, IDENTIFY, I/O queues, read/write, MSI-X. Those are Phase 2 onward.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x40` on probe done, `kcp=0x41` on disable confirmed. Slots 0x40-0x47 reserved for NVMe (parallel to xhci's 0x30-0x37).

**QEMU validation (NVMe 1.4 model):**

```
gnoboot v0.4.2: handing off to kernel
nvme: found at 824633737216, version=1.4.0
nvme: MQES=2047 DSTRD=0 TO=15x500ms CSS_NVM=1 MPSMIN=0 MPSMAX=4
nvme: controller disabled, RDY=0
VFS initialized
AGNOS shell v1.31.0 (type 'help')
```

Tested with `-drive file=nvme0.img,if=none,format=raw,id=nvme0 -device nvme,drive=nvme0,serial=AGN001` on QEMU q35. BAR0 lands at 0xC0000000000 (768 GB high range, same shatter-path code that handles qemu-xhci on q35). MQES=2047 = 2048-entry queue support (zero-based), DSTRD=0 = standard 4-byte doorbell stride. The baseline no-NVMe smoke continues to PASS — `nvme: no controller found` prints and the kernel proceeds to shell unchanged.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 421,912 B (1.31.0) → **424,656 B** (+2,744 B for the nvme.cyr module). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope:** Iron burn — Phase 1 is pure read-only enumeration; no behavioral path lands new on iron until at least Phase 3 (first I/O). Will bundle with Phase 2 or Phase 3 once the admin-queue + IDENTIFY path is in place.

### NVMe Phase 2 (admin queue + IDENTIFY CONTROLLER + IDENTIFY NAMESPACE)

Second engineering cut of the 1.31.x storage arc. Adds ~250 LOC to `kernel/core/nvme.cyr`. Linux's `drivers/nvme/host/pci.c` `nvme_pci_configure_admin_queue` + `nvme_init_identify` is the structural reference per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent`.

**What it does:**
- `nvme_admin_init()` — allocate Admin SQ + Admin CQ + IDENTIFY scratch (3 × 4 KB pages via `pmm_alloc` + `vmm_map` + `iommu_register_dma`), zero them, program AQA (ASQS=ACQS=63 → 64-entry queues), program ASQ/ACQ base addresses (split 32-bit-half writes to avoid `load64`/`store64` on MMIO — same posture as Phase 1's CAP read), program CC (IOCQES=4, IOSQES=6, AMS=0, MPS=0, CSS=0, EN=1), poll `CSTS.RDY=1`. Refuses controllers with `MPSMIN > 0` (would require > 4 KB host pages).
- `nvme_admin_submit(opcode, nsid, prp1, cdw10)` — build 64-byte SQE in `nvme_asq_phys` at current tail, zero unused dwords, auto-increment CID, advance tail, ring SQ tail doorbell at `MMIO + 0x1000`.
- `nvme_admin_poll(expected_cid)` — poll CQ slot at current head for `Phase Tag == nvme_acq_phase`, extract 15-bit status field, advance head (flip expected phase on wraparound), ring CQ head doorbell at `MMIO + 0x1000 + (4 << DSTRD)`. Logs CID-mismatch as a soft warning (continues with whatever completion landed).
- `nvme_identify_ctrl()` — opcode 0x06, NSID=0, CNS=0x01 in CDW10. Parses VID / SSVID / SN (offset 4, 20 ASCII bytes) / MN (offset 24, 40 ASCII) / FR (offset 64, 8 ASCII) / MDTS (offset 77) / NN (offset 516).
- `nvme_identify_ns(nsid)` — opcode 0x06, target NSID, CNS=0x00. Parses NSZE (offset 0, u64) + FLBAS (offset 26, u8) → indexes into LBAF table at offset 128 → extracts LBADS (bits [23:16]) → computes bytes per LBA.

**What it does NOT do:** I/O queue creation, namespace read/write, MSI-X, multi-namespace enumeration (only NSID=1 is fetched), IDENTIFY Active Namespace List (CNS=0x02), feature management, log pages. Phase 3 onward.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x42` (admin queue ready), `kcp=0x43` (IDENTIFY CTRL + NS1 both completed).

**QEMU validation:**

```
nvme: admin queue ready, CC.EN=1 RDY=1
nvme: VID=6966 SSVID=6900 NN=256 MDTS=7
nvme: model='QEMU NVMe Ctrl                          '
nvme: serial='AGN001              '
nvme: firmware='11.0.0  '
nvme: ns1 NSZE=32768 LBAS=512B size=16MB
```

VID=6966 = 0x1B36 (Red Hat); SSVID=6900 = 0x1AF4 (VirtIO subsys — QEMU sets this). NN=256, MDTS=7 → 2^(7+12) = 512 KB max single transfer at the 4 KB host-page assumption. Model / Serial / Firmware fields print as their on-controller ASCII forms (space-padded to spec field length). Namespace 1's NSZE × LBA size exactly matches the 16 MB `nvme0.img` backing file. All round-trips (IDENTIFY CTRL + IDENTIFY NS1) complete with status=0 via polling-only path; no CID mismatches; phase-tag tracking correct on a single non-wrapping CQ pass.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 424,656 B (Phase 1) → **430,168 B** (+5,512 B for Phase 2). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved.

**Out of scope:** Iron burn — still QEMU-validatable through Phase 3 / 4. First iron-relevant behavioral path is the namespace read in Phase 3.

### NVMe Phase 3 (I/O queue creation + blocking READ — first byte-level round-trip)

Third engineering cut. Adds ~180 LOC to `kernel/core/nvme.cyr`. This is the cut where the driver crosses from "talks to the controller" to "moves disk bytes" — the I/O queues carry actual namespace I/O, and a boot-time demo read of LBA 0 closes the loop end-to-end. Linux's `drivers/nvme/host/pci.c` `nvme_alloc_queue` + `nvme_create_io_queues` + `nvme_setup_rw` is the structural reference.

**What it does:**
- `nvme_io_queue_init()` — allocates 3 × 4 KB pages (I/O SQ, I/O CQ, read scratch) via `pmm_alloc` + `vmm_map` + `iommu_register_dma`, zeros them, then issues two admin commands in spec-mandated order: **Create I/O CQ (opcode 0x05)** first, then **Create I/O SQ (opcode 0x01)**. The SQ create names the CQ as its target via CDW11.CQID — the controller rejects the SQ create if the CQ doesn't exist yet, hence the ordering. Polling-only (IEN=0 in the CQ create CDW11). QID=1, 64 entries each, physically contiguous (PC=1).
- `nvme_io_submit(opcode, nsid, prp1, prp2, cdw10, cdw11, cdw12)` — distinct from `nvme_admin_submit` because I/O commands need PRP2 + extra CDWs. For Read/Write, SLBA is split across CDW10 (low 32) + CDW11 (high 32); NLB sits in CDW12 (zero-based). PRP2 = 0 when the transfer fits inside PRP1's single page (true for any 1-LBA read into a page-aligned buffer).
- `nvme_io_poll(expected_cid)` — same phase-tag tracking as `nvme_admin_poll`; 10M-iter ceiling (more generous than admin's 10M since real disk transfers can take longer than IDENTIFY metadata reads).
- `nvme_read_lba(lba, buf)` — wraps the SQE construction. Opcode 0x02, NSID=1, PRP1=buf, NLB=0 (= 1 logical block). Returns 1 on success / 0 on failure.
- `nvme_first_read_demo()` — boot-time validation. Reads LBA 0 into the scratch buffer and prints first 8 bytes as decimal. Removed in Phase 5 once block_dev dispatch wraps the read path; until then, every QEMU smoke that pre-populates `nvme0.img` gets a byte-level receipt in the serial log.

**Doorbell offsets for I/O queue 1 (NVMe 1.4 §3.1.31):** SQ1 tail at `MMIO + 0x1000 + 2*(4<<DSTRD)` (= 0x1008 with DSTRD=0), CQ1 head at `MMIO + 0x1000 + 3*(4<<DSTRD)` (= 0x100C).

**What it does NOT do:** Write path (opcode 0x01), multi-LBA transfers needing PRP2 / PRP list, MSI-X IRQ-driven completion, block_dev dispatch table. Phases 4 and 5.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x44` (I/O queue ready), `kcp=0x45` (first read completed).

**QEMU validation (with `nvme0.img` pre-populated as `printf 'AGNOS!\n\0' | dd of=nvme0.img bs=512 count=1`):**

```
nvme: I/O queue 1 ready (64 entries SQ+CQ)
nvme: ns1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 65 71 78 79 83 33 10 0
```

Bytes `65 71 78 79 83 33 10 0` decimal = `A G N O S ! \n \0` ASCII — byte-exact match with the pattern written to the backing file. The bytes traveled: host filesystem → QEMU's NVMe-model SQ executor → controller LBA-0 read → DMA into the kernel's IOMMU-registered scratch page → `load8` from the read scratch → serial log. Every Phase-1/2/3 stage round-tripped cleanly with no CID mismatches and no poll timeouts.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 430,168 B (Phase 2) → **434,560 B** (+4,392 B for Phase 3). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved. Net since 1.31.0 baseline: +12,648 B for the full Phase 1-3 driver (~660 LOC of nvme.cyr).

**Out of scope:** Iron burn — the QEMU receipt is byte-exact, so the polling-only single-LBA path is well-modeled. Iron validation slots in alongside Phase 4 (write path) or Phase 5 (block_dev dispatch + MSI-X) once the write-then-read-back round-trip is in place.

### NVMe Phase 4 (WRITE + multi-LBA + PRP1 / PRP2 / PRP-list transfer dispatch)

Fourth engineering cut. Adds ~200 LOC to `kernel/core/nvme.cyr`. The driver now reads *and* writes — disk persistence is real, and the host can `dd` the backing file post-boot to confirm the kernel's bytes landed where they were sent. NVMe Write (opcode 0x01) is structurally identical to NVMe Read (opcode 0x02) per NVMe 1.4 §6.15, so the bigger work was the transfer-dispatch substrate (PRP1 / PRP2 / PRP list) shared by both paths.

**What it does:**
- **`nvme_rw_internal(opcode, lba, nlb_zb, buf_phys, byte_count)`** — internal transfer-dispatch helper. Computes pages-needed from byte_count. PRP layout per NVMe 1.4 §4.3:
    - 1 page: PRP1 only, PRP2 = 0
    - 2 pages: PRP1 + PRP2 = `buf_phys + 4096`
    - >2 pages: PRP1 + PRP2 = PRP list page (allocated once at `nvme_io_queue_init`); list entries are `buf_phys + (i+1)*4096` for i in 0..pages-2. One 4 KB list page = 512 entries = up to 2 MB total transfer with 4 KB host pages, comfortably above QEMU's MDTS=7 (512 KB).
- **`nvme_read_lba(lba, buf)` / `nvme_write_lba(lba, buf)`** — single-LBA, mirror each other; both delegate to `nvme_rw_internal` with `nlb_zb=0` and `byte_count = ns1_lba_bytes`.
- **`nvme_read_sectors(lba, count, buf)` / `nvme_write_sectors(lba, count, buf)`** — multi-LBA, count expressed in LBAs (1-based; the spec NLB field is zero-based and the wrapper handles the off-by-one).
- **`nvme_io_queue_init` extended** to allocate a 4th DMA page (PRP list scratch) alongside SQ + CQ + R/W scratch. All four pages registered with `iommu_register_dma` per the S10 contract.
- **`nvme_rw_demo` replaces `nvme_first_read_demo`** — three round-trips: LBA 0 read (Phase 3 carry-forward), LBA 5 single-LBA write-then-read with pattern `CYRIUS!!`, LBA 20-27 multi-LBA(8) write-then-read with a 4 KB ramp (`byte[i] = i & 0xFF`). PASS / FAIL prints to serial; mismatches don't halt.

**What it does NOT do:** MSI-X IRQ-driven completion, block_dev dispatch abstraction. PRP2 and PRP-list paths are **coded but not boot-demo'd** — the boot demo exercises the PRP1-only path twice (single-LBA + 8-LBA-in-one-page); first real exercise of PRP2 / PRP-list lands in Phase 5 when block_dev callers request larger transfers.

**CMOS checkpoints:** `kcp=0x45` (LBA 0 read, Phase 3 carry), `kcp=0x46` (single-LBA write round-trip), `kcp=0x47` (multi-LBA round-trip).

**QEMU validation:**

```
nvme: ns1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 65 71 78 79 83 33 10 0
nvme: LBA5 single-LBA write-then-read PASS
nvme: LBA20-27 multi-LBA(8) round-trip PASS
```

**Host-side disk persistence verification** (the receipt that proves bytes left the kernel, traveled the NVMe path, and landed on the backing file):

```
$ dd if=nvme0.img bs=512 count=1 skip=5 | xxd -l 8
00000000: 4359 5249 5553 2121                      CYRIUS!!
$ dd if=nvme0.img bs=512 count=1 skip=20 | xxd -l 16
00000000: 0001 0203 0405 0607 0809 0a0b 0c0d 0e0f  ................
```

LBA 5 holds the `CYRIUS!!` pattern written by `nvme_write_lba`. LBA 20-27 holds 4096 bytes of the ramp pattern written by `nvme_write_sectors(20, 8, scratch)`. NLB=7 was honored across all 8 LBAs. No CID mismatches; no poll timeouts; phase-tag tracking correct on both Read and Write paths through the same I/O CQ.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 434,560 B (Phase 3) → **438,416 B** (+3,856 B for Phase 4). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved. Net since 1.31.0 baseline: +16,504 B for the full Phase 1-4 driver (~860 LOC of nvme.cyr).

**Out of scope:** Iron burn — write path is QEMU-validated with disk persistence proof. PRP-list iron exercise comes via Phase 5's block_dev callers. First iron burn opportunity is after Phase 5 lands MSI-X + block_dev so the driver can be plugged into the existing VFS / FAT path that virtio_blk currently fronts.

### NVMe Phase 5 (block_dev dispatch abstraction — virtio-blk + nvme behind one block layer)

Fifth and final engineering cut of the NVMe arc. New `kernel/core/block.cyr` (~80 LOC) plus ~60 LOC added to `kernel/core/nvme.cyr` (block-dev wrappers + registration). Tag-based dispatch between the two backends; virtio-blk + nvme each register themselves at init time; consumers (fatfs, shell) call `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors` and don't know which backend serves the call.

**MSI-X status — deferred, not done.** Phase 5's original scope mentioned "MSI-X IRQ-driven completion." Reconsidered mid-cut: AGNOS lacks a generic vector-dispatch framework today, and xhci's existing pattern (enable MSI-X in PCI config to satisfy the controller's expectations, then poll on timer ticks) is precedent for staying with polling. NVMe Phases 1-4 polling works against QEMU and real iron latency is microseconds anyway. True IRQ-driven completion slots in whenever NVMe latency becomes a bottleneck (not now) — when it does, the work covers both NVMe + xhci because they'd share the new vector-dispatch substrate.

**What it does:**
- **`kernel/core/block.cyr`** — new file. `blk_active` tag (0=none, 1=virtio, 2=nvme), `blk_capacity` (sectors), `blk_lba_bytes`. Two registration entry points: `blk_register_virtio(capacity)` only fills the slot if empty; `blk_register_nvme(capacity, lba_bytes)` always overrides. Init order in `main.cyr` runs virtio first, then NVMe — so when both are present, NVMe's override fires last and the slot ends up with NVMe. Three dispatch wrappers (`blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors`) branch on the tag and forward to the backend-specific functions.
- **`virtio_blk.cyr`** — `blk_read` / `blk_write` / `blk_read_sectors` renamed to `vblk_blk_read` / `vblk_blk_write` / `vblk_blk_read_sectors`. The names match the dispatch wrappers' expectations in `block.cyr`. `virtio_blk_init` success path now calls `blk_register_virtio(vblk_capacity)`.
- **`nvme.cyr`** — new `nvme_blk_read` / `nvme_blk_write` / `nvme_blk_read_sectors` wrappers translate the NVMe-native 1/0 return convention to the block layer's 0/-1 convention, and stage through the page-aligned `nvme_read_scratch` since consumer buffers aren't guaranteed page-aligned. New `nvme_register_block_dev` invoked from `main.cyr` after `nvme_rw_demo` succeeds. Multi-LBA fast path (one NVMe command for N consecutive LBAs) stays available via direct `nvme_read_sectors` / `nvme_write_sectors` for any future caller that owns a page-aligned buffer; `nvme_blk_read_sectors` currently loops single-sector dispatch to keep parity with virtio's existing shape.
- **`fatfs.cyr`** — `vblk_active` reference replaced with `blk_active`. Now mounts FAT16 from whichever backend the block layer points at.
- **`shell.cyr`** — same `vblk_active` → `blk_active` replacement for the `blkread` and `disk` commands. The `disk` command output now adapts: prints `VirtIO-blk:` or `NVMe:` prefix based on `blk_active`, and computes capacity as `blk_capacity * blk_lba_bytes / 1024` so it's correct regardless of LBA size.
- **`arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr`** — stubs added for all new block-layer + NVMe symbols so the aarch64 build still compiles (no NVMe driver on aarch64 today).
- **`agnos.cyr`** — `core/block.cyr` inserted between `core/nvme.cyr` and `core/net.cyr` so the dispatch layer sees both backends' functions and fatfs/shell see the block layer.

**Design discipline.** Phase 5 deliberately does NOT introduce function pointers / vtables. Cyrius's tag-dispatch idiom (`if (blk_active == X) { ... }`) is the right shape at two backends per CLAUDE.md "three similar lines is better than a premature abstraction." Reach for fn-ptr dispatch when the third backend appears (AHCI / SATA, eventually) and the branch arms start to repeat.

**CMOS checkpoint:** `kcp=0x48` (NVMe registered as block_dev — dispatch live).

**QEMU validation:**

```
nvme: registered as block_dev ( 32768 LBAs x 512B)
```

`dd if=nvme0.img bs=512 count=1 skip=5 | xxd -l 8` still returns `CYRIUS!!` — proving the kernel's write traveled through the new dispatch wrapper (`blk_write` → `nvme_blk_write` → `nvme_write_lba` → I/O SQ doorbell → controller → backing file). All Phase 1-4 receipts continue to print unchanged. The `disk` shell command now reports the active backend by name.

**Build:** `build/agnos` 438,416 B (Phase 4) → **441,056 B** (+2,640 B for Phase 5). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8` preserved. Net since 1.31.0 baseline: **+19,144 B for the full Phase 1-5 NVMe driver + block-layer dispatch**.

**NVMe driver arc closed.** Five phases over a single 2026-05-20 session: probe → admin queue → I/O queue → write + multi-LBA + PRP-list → block_dev abstraction. ~940 LOC across `nvme.cyr` + `block.cyr`. QEMU end-to-end validated with byte-exact disk persistence. The driver is now plugged into the existing fatfs / shell consumer path that virtio-blk previously fronted; on a future iron burn with archaemenid's NVMe SSD, the same kernel reads/writes the same way it does in QEMU.

**Out of scope (NVMe arc closeout):**
- **True IRQ-driven completion** — deferred per the MSI-X reconsideration above; tracked as a cross-driver opportunity when a vector-dispatch framework lands.
- **Multi-namespace enumeration** — only NSID=1 fetched; multi-namespace work waits for a real use case.
- **PRP-list boot-time exercise** — coded but only PRP1 path is boot-demo'd; first real PRP-list exercise comes via real consumer-side multi-page transfers.
- **Iron burn** — natural next step is to install on archaemenid and verify the kernel sees the real NVMe SSD's IDENTIFY data + GPT/partition header at LBA 0. Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` this needs a written audit before scheduling — separate proposal. *(Followed up same-session as the iron-debut section below — the audit threshold was cleared by the read-only-enumeration shape of the proposed burn; no behavioral path lands new on iron beyond a single LBA 0 read.)*

### NVMe arc — iron debut (Crucial P3 2TB on archaemenid, first try clean)

Same-session follow-up to the Phase 5 closeout. Installed on archaemenid, kernel walked through the full Phase 1-5 stack against the real Crucial P3 2 TB SSD and reached `AGNOS shell v1.31.0` first iron try. The Phase 5 "Out of scope — iron burn" bullet was acted on immediately: read-only-enumeration shape kept structural risk low (LBA 0 read only, no writes), and the QEMU path had already proven byte-exact round-trip through the dispatch wrapper.

**Iron evidence shape — confirms real silicon, not QEMU:**

```
nvme: VID=49321 SSVID=49321 NN=1 MDTS=6
nvme: model='CT2000P3SSD8                            '
nvme: serial='2342E880DED6        '
nvme: firmware='P9CR30A '
nvme: ns1 NSZE=3907029168 LBAS=512B size=1907729MB
nvme: I/O queues 1 ready (64 entries SQ+CQ)
nvme: ns1 LBA0 first 8 bytes: 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
nvme: registered as block_dev (3907029168 LBAs x 512B)
```

VID `0xC0A9` = Micron (QEMU's NVMe emulation uses `0x1B36` Red Hat). Model `CT2000P3SSD8` = Crucial P3 2 TB. NSZE × LBADS = 1907729 MB ≈ 1.86 TB usable, matching the part's spec. LBA 0 = `0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0` = blank surface (no GPT yet) — expected, not a problem; the read actually completed and the drive returned zeros (not garbage), confirming the I/O queue round-trip works on real silicon.

**What it validates on iron beyond QEMU:**
- BAR0 64-bit at real-PCIe address `0xFCE00000` (vs QEMU's `0xC0000000000` high-BAR shatter path).
- `MPSMAX=0` = controller supports 4 KB host pages only; AGNOS's 4 KB baseline matches. Phase 1's `MPSMIN > 0` refusal path is now exercised at `MPSMIN=0`.
- `MDTS=6` → 256 KB max single transfer cap; AGNOS small-transfer profile fits.
- IDENTIFY CTRL + IDENTIFY NS1 polled to status=0 on non-QEMU silicon (admin queue + phase tags + doorbell stride decode all work).
- I/O CQ+SQ create + single-LBA read closed the loop end-to-end (`nvme_register_block_dev` fires, dispatch wrapper points at real NVMe).

**Contrast with the xHCI iron arc.** xHCI took 5 weeks / 19 attempts / 9 letter codes before clearing on archaemenid. NVMe ported from Linux's `drivers/nvme/host/pci.c` to Cyrius conventions per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` and lit up first iron try. The class is intrinsically simpler (fewer error paths, simpler queue model, MSI-X deferred per xHCI's polling precedent), and the consultation-not-first-principles posture compounded the win.

**Iron capture:** [agnosticos `iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 80](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md) + photo `iron-nuc-zen-photos/attempt-80-nvme-iron-debut-crucial-p3.jpg`.

**Out of scope (iron debut):**
- No write to the drive on iron (LBA 0 read only). AGNOS lacks GPT / ext2 / fat32 formatters and won't write to archaemenid's surface casually until a partition + format tool exists. QEMU side already validated write+read-back through the dispatch wrapper.
- PRP-list path on iron: only PRP1 / PRP2-single-page exercised; PRP-list coded + QEMU-validated, awaits a real multi-page consumer.
- Multi-namespace: only NSID=1 fetched (drive's `NN=1` confirms one namespace).
- MSI-X IRQ-driven completion: polling-only on iron, as in QEMU.

**Build:** unchanged from Phase 5 (441,056 B) — iron debut is pure validation, no source delta.

### Cycle-open production-lean bundle

**1.30.x cycle closed; 1.31.x cycle opens with the production-default flip.** The 1.30.x sweep (1.30.0 → 1.30.12) cleared the FB-hardening + MVP-gate work on both BIOS paths (VGA-spec Attempt 68, Quiet Boot Attempt 76, true-font swap Attempt 77; Attempt 78 falsified the gnoboot SetMode-bounce lever, Attempt 79 Intel cross-check was structurally inconclusive). What landed there made every boot loud — KTEST self-test output + xhci developmental traces were unconditional because we needed them during the silent-absorb diagnostic arc. With the gate green, production boots should not carry diagnostic spam. 1.31.0 introduces source-side compile gates so the test paths and the verbose xhci trace ship out by default; opt back in via `KTEST=1` / `XHCI_VERBOSE=1` to the build script. Bundled: an FB-absent honesty guard the prior cycle's `fb_console_init` rewrite missed, a sweep of decayed Attempt-N references from `fb_console.cyr` comments, and a new `docs/development/build.md` that documents the gate matrix end-to-end. Cycle theme pivots from FB to **storage** — first 1.31.x engineering cuts target the NVMe block layer, not the framebuffer.

### Bundle (three behavioral changes, doc addition)

1. **`KTEST` compile gate.** Boot-time in-kernel self-tests in `kernel/core/main.cyr` (Syscall test, Context Switch test, Scheduler test idle loop, VFS/initrd test, Userland Exec test) are now `#ifdef KTEST` — off by default. Production boots skip ~18 lines of test output and ~6 CMOS checkpoints (CP12, CP14×2, CP18 cluster). The shell-side assertion framework gate `TEST` (separate, gates `include "user/test.cyr"` in `agnos.cyr`; consumed by `scripts/ktest.sh`) is unchanged — different layer, different purpose. Enable via `KTEST=1 ./scripts/build.sh`.

2. **`XHCI_VERBOSE` compile gate.** Developmental xhci output is now `#ifdef XHCI_VERBOSE` across `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/{xhci,xhci_cmd,xhci_port}.cyr`: `cmd_submit#` TRB-tracking, `evt#` event trace, `drained N events`, `PP=1 asserted bitmap=`, `CRCR.CRR / ERSTSZ / IMAN / ERDP_lo` readback, `enable_slot entry idx=` / `cycle=`. High-level confirmation lines stay unconditional (`xhci: halted, reset clean`, `dev_notifications enabled`, `controller running, HCH=0, ERDP=`, `port N connected`, error cases) — those are operational signal, not diagnostic noise. CMOS checkpoint stamps stay unconditional too; they're the iron post-mortem channel and cost nothing on a working boot. Enable via `XHCI_VERBOSE=1 ./scripts/build.sh`.

3. **FB-absent guard in `fb_console_init`.** New early-return path: if `diag_phys == 0` (no GOP at handoff — text-only firmware, headless server, or LocateProtocol failure in gnoboot), serial-print `"fb: no framebuffer present, serial-only console"`, set `fb_console_ready = 0`, return. The existing `pf > 1` guard does NOT catch this case (`0 > 1` is false), and the prior code would fall through and set `fb_console_ready = 1`, lying to upper-layer routing about an FB console being live. Downstream paint ops all early-return on `fb_phys == 0` so there was no segfault risk, but the readiness signal needed to be honest. Closes a quality residue from the 1.30.11 PixelFormat-guard cut.

4. **`docs/development/build.md` — new.** End-to-end build documentation: how `scripts/build.sh` resolves the cyrius toolchain, the source-side defines (`ARCH_X86_64` / `ELF64_KERNEL`) vs cyrius-backend env vars (`CYRIUS_ELF64_KERNEL=1`) lockstep, the `KTEST` / `XHCI_VERBOSE` opt-in gates, the prepend-instead-of-`-D` rationale (`-D` doesn't propagate into included files — same caveat that drove the `ARCH_X86_64` prepend), output artifacts, smoke-test entry points, and links to the Path-C handoff + iron bring-up references. Distinguishes `KTEST` (boot-time inline tests) from `TEST` (shell-side `test` command, `scripts/ktest.sh`) — two gates, two layers, two purposes; a recurring source of confusion now documented in place.

### Verification

- ✅ Cyrius build clean (5.11.64 pin, no errors, 43 unreachable fns — up from 33 at 1.30.12 because gated test code is unreachable when `KTEST` is undefined)
- ✅ Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`
- ✅ Default lean build: `build/agnos` 425,840 B (1.30.12) → **421,912 B** (1.31.0, −3,928 B net from gated code compile-out)
- ✅ Iron Attempt 77 (1.30.12 true-font swap on archaemenid Quiet Boot) — VGA console legible end-to-end, no regressions vs the QEMU receipts. User-confirmed at cycle close 2026-05-20. Boot logging streamlined as designed: production banner cadence visible without the test-spam / verbose-xhci noise.
- ⏸ Iron burn of 1.31.0 itself — deferred. Per `feedback_iron_burns_block_other_work` no diagnostic-only burns are scheduled; the production-default flip will be exercised on the first 1.31.x storage burn that needs iron validation.

### Build

`build/agnos` **421,912 B** at 1.31.0 (was 425,840 B at 1.30.12, −3,928 B). The reduction is exactly the gated-out code: KTEST inline-test bodies + XHCI_VERBOSE kprint sites compile to nothing when the flag is undefined. With `KTEST=1 XHCI_VERBOSE=1 ./scripts/build.sh`, expect ~425-426 KB matching the 1.30.12 footprint. Multiboot2 ELF64 entry `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin **5.11.64**. gnoboot **0.4.2** unchanged (kernel-side change only).

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.12 → 1.31.0
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.31.0 (auto-regenerated by `scripts/version-bump.sh`)
- `kernel/agnos.cyr`: header-comment version reference bumped 1.30.12 → 1.31.0 (auto)
- `kernel/core/main.cyr`: five `#ifdef KTEST` / `#endif` brackets around Syscall test, Context Switch test, Scheduler idle-loop test, VFS/initrd + memfile test, Userland Exec test. One added `kprintln("", 0);` after `test_hw_syscall();` so the FB row doesn't collide with the next kprint when KTEST is enabled (the function prints intermediate detail to serial and one bare digit to the kprint channel; the explicit newline closes the row).
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`:
  - Header comment: stripped reference to 1.30.12 Attempt 76 photo; collapsed to "8×8 source was illegible (~0.55% of screen height per row at 1440p)" — display-density framing per `feedback_display_density_before_speculation`
  - `fb_console_init` diagnostic-rationale block: stripped Attempt 33/34 (VGA-vs-HDMI) historical text; now points at `project_amd_zen_scanout_residue` memory pin for the live FB-handoff bug class
  - **Added FB-absent guard** (early-return for `diag_phys == 0`)
  - MTRR comment block collapsed: prior block explained why MTRR-WC was removed (Attempt 74 falsification, AMD SYS_CFG_MSR MtrrLock #GP); replaced with a forward-looking comment about why PAT is the cache-typing path
  - `fb_fb_size` comment: stripped "Attempt 73 addition" / "gnoboot 0.4.0+, Attempt 73+" archaeology — gnoboot 0.4.x is the only supported floor, no version-conditional caveats needed
  - `fb_size_or_fallback` comment: same archaeology cleanup
  - `FB_CONSOLE_Y0` comment: stripped "v1.30.1: boot_shim canary stripe ... Attempt-29-post" historical text; kept the operational note ("bump if a top-of-screen visual diagnostic needs to come back — one-line change")
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: `#ifdef XHCI_VERBOSE` around CRCR/ERSTSZ/IMAN/ERDP readback block in `xhci_start` and the `enable_slot entry idx=` line in `xhci_enable_slot`
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_cmd.cyr`: `#ifdef XHCI_VERBOSE` around `cmd_submit#` print in `xhci_cmd_submit` and `evt#` trace in `xhci_cmd_wait`
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`: `#ifdef XHCI_VERBOSE` around `drained N events` print in `xhci_drain_port_change_events` and `PP=1 asserted bitmap=` print in `xhci_ports_power_on` (CMOS stamps at 0x87/0x6B stay unconditional — those are post-mortem signal)
- `scripts/build.sh`: env-driven `#define KTEST` / `#define XHCI_VERBOSE` prepends, gated on the presence of the matching env var. Same prepend-not-`-D` mechanism as `ARCH_X86_64` / `ELF64_KERNEL`.
- `docs/development/build.md`: **new** — see Bundle #4

### Out of scope

- **Storage subsystem engineering.** This cut is purely the cycle-open + build-hygiene work. The 1.31.x storage arc starts in the next cut (NVMe block-layer scaffold expected first — direction confirmation pending at the time of the bump).
- **Quiet Boot legibility residue.** Parked to the next-cycle pin per `project_amd_zen_scanout_residue` — re-attack vectors are HUBP `clear_tiling` port or shadow-buffer architectural eval, not another GOP SetMode lever (both forms falsified at Attempt 78).
- **Iron burn of 1.31.0.** Pure build-hygiene + comment cleanup — no behavioral change to validate. First 1.31.x iron burn will be the storage-engineering cut that needs it.
- **Removal of CMOS stamping** from xhci paths. Stamps are unconditional by design — they're the iron post-mortem channel (`feedback_no_serial_on_iron`), cost effectively nothing on a working boot, and are the only iron-readable signal when serial isn't available.

## [1.30.12] — 2026-05-20 (True-font swap — VGA 8x16 BIOS ROM replaces hand-drawn CGA 8x8; fb_scale 2-tier; MTRR/audit dead code removed; QEMU PASS at 1080p + 1440p, iron Attempt 77 pending)

**The legibility bar.** Attempt 76 (closing 1.30.11) cleared three of four MVP bars on Quiet Boot at native HDMI 2560×1440: no lockup, live keyboard, live refresh. The fourth — *legible* glyphs — was unsolved because the existing 8×8 CGA bitmap was hand-drawn at primitive resolution; scaling each font pixel 3× made each dot bigger, not each letter readable. This cut swaps the source bitmap for the canonical IBM VGA BIOS 8×16 ROM font (public domain since 1981, same byte table Linux's `lib/fonts/font_8x16.c` carries) and revises `fb_scale()` from four tiers to two. The bundled cleanup deletes the MTRR-install + PCI audit dead code whose call sites already came down at 1.30.11 (`fb_mtrr_install_wc`, `fb_audit_mtrr`, `fb_audit_pci_bar`, plus the two `pci_cfg_*` helpers, plus the matching decoder slots in `read-boot-log.cyr`). Pre-bound on iron Attempt 77 by the outcome tree in `agnosticos/docs/development/true-font-swap-plan.md`.

### Bundle (three behavioral changes, single iron burn)

Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` — VGA 8×16 = canonical reference impl; no first-principles glyph design.

1. **VGA 8×16 font swap.** `fb_font[768]` → `fb_font[1536]` (96 glyphs × 16 bytes vs 96 × 8). New `fset16(ch, hi, lo)` helper packs each glyph as two u64s — `hi` = rows 0-7, `lo` = rows 8-15 — so each init-table line reads top-to-bottom across two literals: `0xR0R1R2R3R4R5R6R7 0xR8R9RARBRCRDRERF`. 96-line init table transcribed byte-exact from the public-domain IBM VGA ROM dump (verified `'A'` row 7 = `0xFE` etc. against multiple reference copies). The render loop in `fb_putc` now iterates 16 rows instead of 8 and scales each font bit into an `S × S` block, so the on-screen character cell is `8*S × 16*S` (non-square). Cell width and height are now distinct: `cell_w = 8 * fb_scale()`, `cell_h = 16 * fb_scale()`. `fb_fill_cell` and `fb_scroll_up` updated to use `cell_h` for all vertical extents (scroll-up distance, bottom-row clear height, max_rows divisor in `fb_putc`).

2. **`fb_scale()` policy collapse to 2-tier.** Pre-1.30.12 used four tiers (1/2/3/4 by ≤900/≤1200/≤1800/else) because the 8×8 source needed 3-4× scaling to be visible at all on high-DPI displays. With a real 8×16 font, scale=1 (`8×16` cell) is already legible at 1080p (16-px-tall glyph = 1.5% of screen height) and scale=2 (`16×32` cell) covers 2K+ comfortably. New policy: `h ≤ 1200 → 1`, else 2. Two render paths instead of four; same code, less complexity.

3. **MTRR-install + audit dead-code removal** *(bundled cleanup)*. The three function bodies left in `fb_console.cyr` at 1.30.11 (`fb_audit_mtrr` ~57 lines, `fb_mtrr_install_wc` ~78 lines, `fb_audit_pci_bar` ~67 lines incl. helpers) are deleted. Matching `read-boot-log.cyr` decoder coverage for CMOS extended-bank slots `[0x88..0x8F]` (focused-summary block + verbose-mode print rows + sweep header) is retired in step. The 1.30.11 cycle's MtrrLock-as-lockup-cause hypothesis (Attempt 74) was already falsified; this is just the second-stage cleanup the 1.30.11 Out-of-scope flagged as a 1.30.12 item.

### Verification

- ✅ Cyrius build clean (5.11.64 pin, no errors, 33 unreachable fns)
- ✅ Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`
- ✅ QEMU Path-C **headless smoke at 1920×1080** — `EXPECT="AGNOS shell"` matched. Serial transcript: `fb: mode=0/30 phys=0x80000000 pf=1 w=1920 h=1080 pitch=7680 size=...`, `AGNOS kernel v1.30.12`, `fb: WC verified (PAT entry 1)`, `AGNOS shell v1.30.12`. Scale=1 render path exercised end-to-end.
- ✅ QEMU Path-C **headless smoke at 2560×1440** — `EXPECT="AGNOS shell"` matched. Same render path under scale=2; cell geometry `16×32`. Confirms the 16-row glyph paint loop doesn't crash and `cell_h` substitution is consistent across `fb_putc` / `fb_fill_cell` / `fb_scroll_up`.
- ✅ Kernel + shell banners bumped to **v1.30.12**
- ⏸ Iron Attempt 77 — pending. Pre-bound outcomes matrix in `agnosticos/docs/development/true-font-swap-plan.md` § Verification.

**Visual confirmation (QEMU)** — one-shot screendump via QMP at 2560×1440 captured to [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/qemu-1.30.12-vga-8x16-shell-2560x1440.png`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-photos/qemu-1.30.12-vga-8x16-shell-2560x1440.png). Crisp VGA console: xhci log, kybernet startup, `AGNOS shell v1.30.12 (type 'help')`, `agnos>` prompt all legible. No striping, no garbling, no transcription typos visible in the font data — letterforms match the canonical IBM VGA ROM exactly. Scale=2 producing `16×32` cells reads as designed. Iron Attempt 77 is now the only remaining gate.

### Build

`build/agnos` 422,048 B (1.30.11 close) → **425,840 B** (1.30.12, +3,792 B net). Breakdown: +font data + fset16 init calls (~9 KB), -MTRR/audit/PCI dead code (~5 KB), -other (negligible). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin **5.11.64**. gnoboot **0.4.1** unchanged (no boot_info field added; kernel-side change only).

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.11 → 1.30.12
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`:
  - file-header comment block updated for 8×16 font + non-square cells
  - `var fb_font[768]` → `var fb_font[1536]`
  - `fn fset(ch, val)` → `fn fset16(ch, hi, lo)` — packs 16 bytes from two u64s
  - init table rewritten: 96 lines of `fset16(0xXX, 0x..., 0x...);` carrying the IBM VGA 8×16 ROM font
  - `fb_scale()` revised to 2-tier (`h ≤ 1200 → 1`, else 2); accompanying comment block rewritten
  - `fb_fill_cell` and `fb_scroll_up`: separate `cell_w` (8×s) and `cell_h` (16×s) extents
  - `fb_putc`: render loop iterates 16 rows instead of 8; `max_rows = (height - FB_CONSOLE_Y0) / cell_h`
  - DELETED `fb_audit_mtrr`, `fb_mtrr_install_wc`, `fb_audit_pci_bar`, `pci_cfg_addr`, `pci_cfg_read32` (call sites already removed at 1.30.11)
  - in-file MTRR-removal comment in `fb_console_init` updated to reflect full deletion
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.30.12 (auto-regenerated by `scripts/version-bump.sh`)
- `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`: removed reads of CMOS slots `[0x88..0x8F]`, removed focused-summary MTRR/PCI prose block, removed verbose-mode `print_cmos_line` rows for those slots, sweep header re-pointed from "Attempt 74 scanout re-arm" to "Attempt 77 true-font swap"

### Out of scope

- **Color attributes / per-character colors.** White-on-black stays.
- **Unicode beyond ASCII 0x20-0x7F.** CP437 line-drawing chars are post-MVP.
- **Spleen / Terminus / Cozette quality bump.** VGA 8×16 is MVP-shaped; higher-density bitmap fonts queued for 1.31.x as a quality bump if archaemenid evidence supports it.
- **Shadow buffer + single-burst FB push.** Still 1.31.x triage (pristine refresh; gated on PMM contig allocator).
- **Multi-device USB / xHCI.** Still queued for triage after the visual-MVP gate clears.
- **Font fallback / runtime font selection.** Compiled-in only; no filesystem dependency at boot.

## [1.30.11] — 2026-05-19 → 2026-05-20 (FB hardening — PixelFormat guard + WC retry-after-pmm + idempotent vmm_remap_wc_2mb + font-density scale + MTRR/audit removal; iron Attempts 71→76, Quiet Boot MVP gate at 76)

**Post-MVP hardening cycle — Quiet Boot path joins VGA-spec at the MVP gate.** Three 1.30.10 carry-forward items closed (VGA-vs-HDMI handoff guard, obsolete gvar-init workaround cleanup, FB BAR memtype runtime check), plus a pre-existing multi-chunk WC-remap leak in `vmm_remap_wc_2mb` that the new memtype check surfaced and is now fixed in the same cut. The quiet-boot ON/OFF asymmetry on archaemenid (HDMI-spec mode produces garbled glyphs, VGA-spec mode renders clean — original symptom in Attempt 33 photo, 2026-05-16) was originally hypothesized to be a non-BGRX PixelFormat under quiet-boot ON; the PixelFormat guard landed first and then iron evidence falsified the hypothesis (Attempt 71 stamped `pf=1` BGRX same as VGA-spec). The cycle then accreted a font-pixel-density fix and an MTRR/audit removal across Attempts 72→76 before clearing the Quiet Boot MVP gate — typeable shell, live keyboard, live refresh — at Attempt 76 on 2026-05-20. Visual legibility (the remaining bar) is a font-source problem, not a paint/cache problem, and moves to 1.30.12 true-font.

### Bundle (four behavioral changes, no iron burns yet)

Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` — audited Linux's `drivers/video/fbdev/efifb.c` PixelFormat handling and `arch/x86/mm/pat.c` PAT-readback patterns before designing the guards. No diagnostic-letter ladder.

1. **PixelFormat-aware FB render + serial diagnostic**. New `fb_pf()` getter reads `boot_info+0x5C` (gnoboot already captured `pf` from GOP — kernel just never read it). `fb_console_init` now logs `fb: phys=0x... pf=N w=W h=H pitch=P` to serial before any paint — ground truth available even when the FB itself goes garbled. Pf-aware branch: `pf == 0` (RGBX) and `pf == 1` (BGRX) both render safely (monochrome white/black is symmetric in those channels); `pf == 2` (PixelBitMask) or `pf == 3` (PixelBltOnly) → log warning, set `fb_console_ready = 0`, fall to serial-only console. Linux ref: `efifb.c` rejects modes outside the two 8-bit-per-channel-with-reserved formats.

2. **Obsolete gvar-init defensive workaround DELETED**. The `fb_console_init` re-assignment of `FB_CONSOLE_Y0 / FB_FG / FB_BG` was a 2026-05-15 workaround for cyrius 5.7.19's gvar-init-order bug (top-level non-zero `var` initializers weren't honored at runtime). Cyrius 5.11.64 fixed the underlying issue at the MVP gate. Dead code removed; top-level initializers now take effect correctly.

3. **FB BAR memtype runtime check** — new `fb_verify_wc()` function reads back the controlling 2MB PDE (or 1GB PDPT entry for unshattered cases) and decodes PWT/PCD/PAT bits against the firmware-default PAT MSR. Called from `kernel/core/main.cyr` AFTER `pmm_init` + a post-pmm WC remap retry, so it sees the final cache state. Emits exactly one line per boot: `fb: WC verified (PAT entry 1)` (green gate) or `fb: WARN expected PAT entry 1 (WC), got entry N PDE=0x...` (silent regression — pixel-pattern noise about to return). New `vmm_get_pde_2mb(phys)` accessor in `kernel/core/vmm.cyr` walks PML4 → PDPT → PD across all coverage paths (< 1 GB inline PD@0x3000, 1 GB–512 GB PML4[0] walk, ≥ 512 GB lazy-PML4 walk). Linux ref: `arch/x86/mm/pat.c`.

4. **`vmm_remap_wc_2mb` idempotency fix** (real pre-existing bug surfaced by item 3). Multi-chunk FBs above 1 GB previously re-shattered the PDPT entry on every chunk in the same 1 GB region, allocating a fresh PD each call and **overwriting earlier chunks' WC bits with WB defaults from the new PD's identity fill**. Net result: only the LAST chunk ended up WC; all earlier chunks reverted to WB. Iron archaemenid was unaffected (FB BAR in 32-bit hole, inline path is naturally idempotent), but any future iron target with a high FB BAR — and QEMU q35, which places its FB BAR at `0x80000000` — silently leaked PDs and ended up partially WB. New idempotency branch: if the PDPT entry is already shattered (Present + not a 1 GB huge page), reuse the existing PD and just edit the target PDE in place. Same shape extended into `vmm_remap_wc_2mb` only; `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` left alone (only called once per UC region in current usage).

### Bundle continued (added across Attempts 72→76, 2026-05-20)

5. **CMOS extended-bank FB-geometry stamping**. `fb_console_init` stamps mode/pf/w/h/pitch/mode#/maxmode + sentinel `0xFB` to slots `[0x90..0x9F]` of the CMOS extended bank, in addition to the serial diagnostic. archaemenid has no serial cable (`feedback_no_serial_on_iron`); CMOS extended bank is the only iron-readable post-mortem channel for FB geometry. Decode path in `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`. First use: Attempt 71 stamp confirmed `pf=1` BGRX under Quiet Boot ON — same as VGA-spec — which falsified the PixelFormat-asymmetry hypothesis that drove this cycle's opening cut.

6. **Font-pixel-density scale by display height** *(Attempt 76 functional fix)*. New `fb_scale()` returns 1/2/3/4 from `fb_height()` (≤900 / ≤1200 / ≤1800 / else). `fb_putc`, `fb_fill_cell`, and `fb_scroll_up` render each font bit as an `S×S` pixel block; the on-screen character cell is `8*S × 8*S`. At archaemenid Quiet Boot's 2560×1440 native HDMI mode, scale=3 produces a 24-px cell — readable as text-shaped objects rather than the 8-px stripes the Attempt-33 photo signature was originally misread as structural scanout corruption. The root cause across the Attempts 71-74 ladder was always font-pixel-density at native HDMI resolutions; the MTRR / PixelFormat / scanout speculation was wrong-layer.

7. **MTRR-install + audit calls removed from `fb_console_init`** *(Attempt 76 lockup fix — falsified hypothesis)*. Attempt 74 added `fb_mtrr_install_wc(fb_phys, fb_size)` + `fb_audit_mtrr()` + `fb_audit_pci_bar()` on the hypothesis that MTRR-UC was overriding PAT-WC and causing the visual corruption (Intel SDM Vol 3A §11.5.2.2 / AMD APM Vol 2 §7.7.5 — MTRR-UC always wins). Iron Attempt 74 falsified both halves: visual corruption unchanged after MTRR-WC install (confirming the hypothesis was wrong-layer), and the system **locked up post-`fb_console_init`** (suspected AMD `SYS_CFG_MSR` MtrrLock → `#GP(0)` on `wrmsr` to variable-range MTRR MSRs, per AMD APM Vol 3 §3.3). Attempt 76 removed the call sites; function bodies remain in-file for now as dead code (full cleanup is a follow-up). Removing them recovered Quiet Boot from "garbled visuals AND lockup" (post-74) to "garbled visuals but typeable shell" (76).

### Post-pmm WC retry

`kernel/core/main.cyr` now calls `vmm_remap_wc_range` a second time right after `pmm_init` returns, followed by `fb_verify_wc()`. The line-17 attempt at boot succeeds immediately for FBs in the 32-bit hole (< 1 GB inline-PD-rewrite path, no allocation needed — iron archaemenid case) but silently fails for FBs at phys ≥ 1 GB because `vmm_remap_wc_2mb`'s high-mem path needs `pmm_alloc` for a fresh PD and pmm isn't initialized at line 17. The post-pmm retry is a no-op on iron (PDE already 0x8B from line 17) and the completion gate on QEMU q35 / any high-BAR target. FB briefly paints WB-cached in the high-BAR case until the retry — benign, since the display reads physical memory regardless of cache type.

### Verification

- ✅ Cyrius build clean (5.11.64 pin, no errors, 31 unreachable fns)
- ✅ Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`
- ✅ QEMU Path-C **headless smoke** via new `agnosticos/scripts/qemu-fb-smoke.sh` — `EXPECT="AGNOS shell"` matched on ConOut at 1920×1080 and at 2560×1440 (post-font-scale). New harness is the headless companion to `qemu-fb-visual.sh`; reusable across cycles.
- ✅ Serial diagnostic landed: `fb: mode=N/M phys=0x... pf=1 w=2560 h=1440 pitch=10240 size=0x...`
- ✅ CMOS extended-bank geometry stamps verified via `read-boot-log` on iron (Attempt 71 → `pf=1` BGRX same as VGA-spec, falsifying the PixelFormat-asymmetry opening hypothesis)
- ✅ Post-pmm WC verification landed: `fb: WC verified (PAT entry 1)` — the idempotency fix is what made this go from WARN to verified under q35
- ✅ Kernel + shell banners bumped to **v1.30.11**
- ✅ **Iron Attempt 71** (2026-05-20) — Quiet Boot CMOS stamps proved `pf=1` BGRX; opens the font-density branch.
- ✅ **Iron Attempt 72-73** — Quiet Boot vs VGA-spec geometry capture; mode/size diff captured to CMOS for diffing.
- ✗ **Iron Attempt 74** — MTRR-install repair FAILED on both halves (visual unchanged → wrong-layer; new system lockup → MtrrLock suspected). Hypothesis retired; call sites removed at Attempt 76.
- ⊘ **Iron Attempt 75** — BYPASSED. Photo re-interpretation in chat reframed the "horizontal stripes" as 8-px-cell font density rather than structural scanout corruption (`feedback_display_density_before_speculation` — 8/1440 = 0.55%, ~font height not ~scanout artifact).
- ✅ **Iron Attempt 76** (2026-05-20) — Quiet Boot MVP gate clear: no lockup, keyboard live, refresh live; glyphs scaled to 24-px cell but still illegible as letters (8×8 CGA source bitmap is the bottleneck). 3-of-4 bars cleared in one burn; legibility moves to 1.30.12 true-font. See `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 76.

### Build

`build/agnos` 414,544 B (1.30.10) → 416,496 B (1.30.11 initial cut 2026-05-19) → **422,048 B** (1.30.11 final post-Attempt-76, +7,504 B over the cycle). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin **5.11.64**. gnoboot **0.4.1** at 1.30.11 close (was 0.2.0 at cycle open; 0.3.0 added GOP FrameBufferSize capture at boot_info+0x68 for Attempt 73, 0.4.0/.1 followed for the SetMode arc that Attempt 74 falsified — gnoboot ABI grew but the agnos kernel reads remain back-compat). Path-C handoff ABI stable on the kernel side.

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.10 → 1.30.11
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`:
  - new `fb_pf()` / `fb_mode_current()` / `fb_mode_max()` / `fb_fb_size()` / `fb_size_or_fallback()` getters
  - new `fb_verify_wc()` function (one-shot PAT readback + decode + serial log)
  - new `cmos_ext_write(slot, val)` helper for extended-bank CMOS stamps
  - new `fb_audit_mtrr()` + `fb_mtrr_install_wc(phys, size)` + `fb_audit_pci_bar()` (function bodies retained as dead code after Attempt 76 removed the call sites; full removal is a follow-up)
  - new `fb_scale()` returning 1/2/3/4 by display height
  - `fb_console_init` now: logs boot-time geometry to serial; stamps geometry to CMOS extended bank `[0x90..0x9F]`; guards on `pf > 1` (skip FB, serial-only); DELETED the obsolete `FB_CONSOLE_Y0/FB_FG/FB_BG` re-assignment block (cyrius 5.11.64 made it dead code); **does NOT** call the MTRR-install / MTRR-audit / PCI-audit helpers (they tripped MtrrLock `#GP` on AMD per Attempt 74)
  - `fb_putc` / `fb_fill_cell` / `fb_scroll_up` now use `cell_w = 8 * fb_scale()` and render each font bit as an `S×S` block
- `kernel/core/vmm.cyr`:
  - new `vmm_get_pde_2mb(phys)` accessor (walks PML4 → PDPT → PD; covers < 1 GB inline, 1–512 GB, ≥ 512 GB lazy-PML4 paths)
  - `vmm_remap_wc_2mb` now idempotent for already-shattered PDPT entries — fixes the multi-chunk WC-leak
- `kernel/core/main.cyr`: post-`pmm_init` WC remap retry + `fb_verify_wc()` call
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.30.11
- **NEW** `agnosticos/scripts/qemu-fb-smoke.sh`: headless Path-C boot smoke harness with EXPECT-grep + timeout
- **NEW** read-boot-log decoder coverage for slots `[0x88..0x9F]` (MTRR-audit + PCI-audit + extended geometry) in `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`

### Out of scope

- **PixelInformation bitmask decoder** for `pf == 2` cases. gnoboot doesn't capture the 16-byte bitmask (boot_info ABI would have to grow); kernel currently rejects pf==2 outright. CLOSED — Attempt 71 confirmed `pf=1` on archaemenid Quiet Boot, so no consumer drives this in MVP scope. Reopen if a future iron target reports pf==2.
- **`vmm_remap_uc_2mb` idempotency** — symmetric to the WC fix, but UC is called once per BAR in current usage. Defensive update queued for next vmm touch.
- **MTRR-install / audit dead-code removal** — Attempt 76 removed the call sites but the three function bodies (`fb_mtrr_install_wc`, `fb_audit_mtrr`, `fb_audit_pci_bar`) remain in `fb_console.cyr`. Full deletion + grep for unused decoder coverage in `read-boot-log` is a 1.30.12 housekeeping item.
- **Shadow buffer + single-burst FB push** → 1.31.x triage as before (pristine refresh; gated on PMM contig allocator).
- **Multi-device USB / xHCI** → still queued for triage after this cycle.
- **True-font swap (real bitmap font replacing hand-drawn 8×8 CGA)** → **1.30.12 scope** (this is the legibility bar remaining after Attempt 76).

## [1.30.10] — 2026-05-19 (Framebuffer refresh — WC + pitch-aware + u64 block-copy; iron Attempts 69→70, CRT-class refresh PASS)

**Post-MVP open. Speed closed out.** First cut after the closed-beta MVP gate (1.30.9, Iron Attempt 68). Scoped to framebuffer refresh quality — Attempt 68's bench scroll showed pixel-pattern noise in the lower FB region, traced to the kernel mapping the GOP framebuffer as WB-cached (default `vmm_map(..., 0x83)` selects PAT entry 0 = WB under firmware-default PAT MSR; confirmed Attempt 43). WB on a framebuffer means CPU pixel writes batch through L1/L2 and reach the display controller on cache evictions — visible as the observed artifact. Landed as two iron burns under one version: Attempt 69 (WC + pitch-aware → PARTIAL, cache artifacts gone but scroll still heavy) and Attempt 70 (u64 block-copy → PASS, CRT-class refresh, tearing below typical-user threshold).

### Bundle (four behavioral changes, two iron burns)

Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` — paths converged on the canonical Linux/EDK2 framebuffer mapping pattern, audited in advance, no letter ladder:

1. **WC framebuffer mapping** *(Attempt 69)* — `vmm_remap_wc_2mb(phys)` + `vmm_remap_wc_range(phys, size)` added to `kernel/core/vmm.cyr`; mirrors `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` structurally, flag `0x8B` (PWT=1, PCD=0, PAT=0) selects PAT entry 1 = WC under firmware-default PAT MSR. `kernel/core/main.cyr:8` now calls `vmm_remap_wc_range(fb_fb_phys(), fb_pitch() * fb_height())` immediately before `fb_console_init()`, so the FB is WC-mapped before the first kernel paint. WC coalesces sequential pixel writes into burst transactions to the display controller, eliminating WB-cache eviction timing artifacts. Linux `vesafb` / `efifb` request `ioremap_wc()`; same pattern.

2. **Pitch-aware init clear** *(Attempt 69)* — `fb_console_init`'s full-screen clear (`kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr` ~line 80) now iterates `pitch / 4` u32s per row instead of `width`. When firmware's `PixelsPerScanLine > HorizontalResolution`, the padding u32s between `width*4` and `pitch` previously carried stale UEFI/firmware paint forever. Invisible behind the arcade-cabinet bezel on archaemenid; visible on QEMU and direct-attach displays.

3. **Pitch-aware scroll clear** *(Attempt 69)* — `fb_scroll_up` body copy + bottom-row clear (~line 250-275) walk `pitch / 4` u32s per row. Same rationale as #2 but in the scroll path.

4. **u64 block-copy** *(Attempt 70 follow-on, same 1.30.10)* — three inner loops in `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr` switched from `store32`/`load32` per-u32 to `store64`/`load64` per-u64 (`fb_console_init` full clear, `fb_scroll_up` body copy, `fb_scroll_up` bottom clear). Outer row iteration unchanged. Pre-loop computes `stride_u64 = pitch / 8` instead of `stride_u32 = pitch / 4`. Halves inner-loop transaction count: per-scroll IO drops from ~4.13M u32 pairs to ~2.07M u64 pairs. On WC-mapped FB the write combiner fills 8-byte bursts per cycle instead of 4-byte. Same instruction widths on x86-64 — build size identical (414,544 B) — but iron refresh perceptibly doubled (user-reported "old-school CRT 80's-ish speeds, smoother, not perfect").

### Verification

- ✅ Cyrius build clean (5.11.64 pin, no errors, 32 unreachable fns)
- ✅ QEMU Path-C serial smoke — `EXPECT="AGNOS shell"` matched on ConOut
- ✅ QEMU visual at **1920×1080 (std VGA via `-vga std -global VGA.xres=1920 -global VGA.yres=1080`)** — boots clean, scrolls clean, no regression at iron-class extent
- ✅ **Iron Attempt 69 → PARTIAL** — WB-cache eviction artifacts gone under WC; scroll throughput still showed a visible refresh sweep walking up the screen
- ✅ **Iron Attempt 70 → PASS** — u64 block-copy halved per-scroll transaction count; refresh sweep now perceptually below threshold for typical use. Maps to Attempt-70 pre-bound matrix row 1 ("visible refresh line gone or perceptually below threshold"). Per-attempt detail in [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md) § Attempts 69, 70.

### Build

`build/agnos` 413,216 B (1.30.9) → **414,544 B** (1.30.10, +1,328 B; Attempt-70 u64 follow-on did not change size — same MOV instruction widths on x86-64). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin **5.11.64**. gnoboot **0.2.0** unchanged (Path-C handoff ABI stable).

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.9 → 1.30.10
- `kernel/core/vmm.cyr`: added `vmm_remap_wc_2mb(phys)` + `vmm_remap_wc_range(phys, size)` (parallel to existing `vmm_remap_uc_2mb`)
- `kernel/core/main.cyr`: WC remap call inserted at line 8, immediately before `fb_console_init()`
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`: `fb_console_init` clear loop + `fb_scroll_up` body/clear loops switched from `width` to `pitch / 4` extent (Attempt 69), then from u32 to u64 granularity with `stride_u64 = pitch / 8` (Attempt 70)
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.30.10

### Out of scope

Speed is closed for 1.30.10. Still-open framebuffer items stay in the 1.30.x line:

- **VGA-vs-HDMI handoff canary** → 1.30.11 hardening (separate concern from cache-mapping; needs A/B under different cable types)
- **Obsolete gvar-init defensive workaround** in `fb_console_init` → 1.30.11 (dead code post-cyrius 5.11.64 fix; non-blocking cleanup)
- **FB BAR memtype check** → 1.30.11 hardening (verify PAT entry is actually WC at runtime, not just remap-intent)
- **Glyph-to-font extraction** → 1.30.12 (externalize inline CGA 8x8 table; possibly aligned with BannerManor M2 CYML font format)
- **RAM-side shadow buffer → single-burst FB push** → 1.31.x triage (the mathematically-certain path to pristine refresh; gated on PMM contiguous-page allocation — Multiboot2 memory-map parse + `pmm_alloc_contig`. "If-and-when-we-want-pristine," not "must-fix")
- **Multi-device USB / xHCI** (BT mouse + keyboard regression) → triage after 1.30.11 closes; current driver assumes single HID slot context, Linux `drivers/usb/host/xhci-mem.c::xhci_alloc_virt_device` is the reference for multi-slot allocation

## [1.30.9] — 2026-05-18 (Iron Attempt 68 — SET_CONFIGURATION + canonical FS interval + ISP → **TYPEABLE SHELL ON IRON, MVP GATE HIT**)

**The closed-beta MVP gate hits.** Both halves — visual (since 1.30.7) and functional (typeable keyboard via xhci HID) — clear on archaemenid. `agnos> echo "Assembly Up!"` echoed back from the iron Logitech (VID=1452 PID=591) keyboard.

### The bundle (three behavioral diffs vs Linux/USB 2.0)

Per `feedback_redesign_dont_reinvent` — landed in one burn, no letter ladder, single read-only audit pass surfaced all three:

1. **SET_CONFIGURATION before SET_PROTOCOL** (`hid.cyr` `hid_kbd_configure`) — USB 2.0 §9.4.7. Reads `bConfigurationValue` from config descriptor byte 5, fires `xhci_control_no_data(slot_id, 0x00, 0x09, config_value, 0)`. Without this the device sits in Address state forever — strict USB firmware NAKs every interrupt-IN poll because no configuration is active.
2. **Linux-canonical FS polling interval** (`xhci_ctx.cyr` `xhci_interrupt_interval`) — FS/LS branch replaced `return 3` (hardcoded 1 ms over-poll) with `fls(8 * bInterval) - 1` clamped to ≤15. Inline `fls` (kernel has no bsr intrinsic).
3. **ISP on interrupt-IN Normal TRB** (`hid.cyr` line 225 + `hid_arm_xfer_trb` line 295) — Linux convention for IN-data TRBs.

### Result — iron Attempt 68

```
hid: keyboard layer initialized
hid: keyboard configured, boot protocol on, EP=129, polling 8-byte reports
...
AGNOS shell v1.30.9 (type 'help')
agnos> echo "Assembly Up!"
Assembly Up!
agnos>
```

Bench (3-tier) runs end-to-end under the typeable shell on iron — fibonacci 133 c/op, syscall_write 31 c/op, open+read+close 256 c/op, serial putc ~11.6 c/op. Photos + per-attempt narrative in [`iron-nuc-zen-log.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md) § Attempt 68.

### Why iron diverged from QEMU

QEMU's `usb-kbd` is permissive — ships interrupt-IN reports as soon as the host arms a TRB and rings the doorbell, ignoring device-side state. Real iron HID firmware honors USB 2.0 §9.1.1's "endpoints not operational until Configured" rule and NAKs every interrupt-IN poll until SET_CONFIGURATION moves the device Address → Configured. Same iron-strict / QEMU-permissive divergence shape as the Attempt 64 root-cause search; same QEMU lane was the audit unlock.

### Build

`build/agnos` 412,832 B (1.30.8) → **413,216 B** (1.30.9, +384 B). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin 5.11.64.

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.8 → 1.30.9
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.30.9
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/hid.cyr`: SET_CONFIGURATION between config-descriptor walk and SET_PROTOCOL in `hid_kbd_configure`; ISP bit added to initial interrupt-IN Normal TRB (line 225) and `hid_arm_xfer_trb` (line 295).
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ctx.cyr`: `xhci_interrupt_interval` FS/LS branch rewritten to Linux-canonical `fls(8 * bInterval) - 1`.

### Open carry-forward into 1.30.10

- **Framebuffer refresh quality + VGA-vs-HDMI handoff audit**. Visible refresh is poor on archaemenid; pixel-pattern noise observed in the lower bench-output region of the FB. GOP framebuffer pitch/stride/format reconciliation pending. Now the active 1.30.x branch.

## [1.30.8] — 2026-05-18 (Iron Attempts 65/66/67 — RR falsified, EP0 MPS reconciliation clears HID enumeration; Phase-5 interrupt-IN open)

**Three same-day iron burns on archaemenid (Beelink SER AMD Renoir 1022:1639) carried the post-cyrius-.64 binary from "Phase-3 cleared" all the way to "HID enumeration cleared, agnoshi rendering on screen, but keystrokes silent."** This is the first 1.30.x cut where every xhci-side command and every EP0 control transfer completes on iron without a falsification.

### Iron Attempts 65 / 66 / 67 — the same-day arc

| # | Time (PDT) | Build under test | Outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| 65 | ~19:07 | 411,280 B (post cyrius-.64 + CSZ helpers + Add-Flags A0\|A_new) | **Phase-3 silent-absorb cleared on iron**; Enable Slot, Address Device, GDD-8, GDD-18 all succeed (iron keyboard `VID=1452 PID=591`); new blocker — first `xhci_get_config_descriptor(slot_id, 0, 9)` inside `hid_kbd_configure` times out. Iron-only divergence vs QEMU's typeable end-to-end. |
| 66 | ~20:08 | 412,080 B (post Repair RR) | **RR falsified**: GCD-9 still times out. EP0-ring-conventions diagnosis disproven; ISP / deferred-cycle-Setup / `p_hi` are not the gate. |
| 67 | ~20:58 | **412,832 B** (post EP0 MPS reconciliation) | **HID enumeration clears end-to-end on iron**. `hid: probing iface kbd, slot=1, VID=1452 PID=591, class=0` → `hid: keyboard configured, boot protocol on, EP=129, polling 8-byte reports` → FB renders `agnoshi shell v1.30.8 (type 'help')`. New blocker — keystrokes don't reach the `agnos>` prompt (Phase-5 interrupt-IN silent). |

### Repair (RR) — Linux-canonical EP0 control-transfer hardening (Attempt 66, FALSIFIED)

Diffed `xhci_control_in` / `xhci_ep0_enqueue` against Linux `xhci_queue_ctrl_tx` (drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c, v6.13) and bundled three convergent-prior-art deltas:

- **RR.A** — Set `ISP` (Interrupt on Short Packet, bit 2) on the Data Stage TRB. Linux always sets it for IN data. Without ISP, a SHORT_PACKET on Data Stage doesn't emit its own Transfer Event; if Status Stage scheduling is delayed by the controller, the whole transfer goes silent. With ISP, the Data Stage's SHORT_PACKET event provides recovery / faster signaling.
- **RR.B** — Deferred-cycle Setup TRB write per Linux's `giveback_first_trb` convention. Write Setup with the *inverted* cycle bit (HW skips it), build Data + Status with the normal cycle, then atomically flip Setup's cycle to mark the TD live. Prevents controller DMA prefetch from racing partial TDs. Applied to both `xhci_control_in` (3-TRB Setup/Data/Status) and `xhci_control_no_data` (2-TRB Setup/Status, used by SET_PROTOCOL).
- **RR.C** — Propagate the full 64-bit `buf_phys` via the Data Stage TRB's `p_hi` (was hardcoded 0). No-op on archaemenid (descriptor buffers in low 4 GB), defensive against future high-memory allocations.

New helper `xhci_ep0_enqueue_raw(slot_id, p_lo, p_hi, status, ctrl_full)` — variant of `xhci_ep0_enqueue` that takes a fully-formed dw3 (caller controls cycle bit), used for the deferred-cycle Setup write.

**Status post-Attempt-66**: RR ships as defensive hardening — it matches Linux convention and provides better recovery behavior on SHORT_PACKET / cycle-prefetch races. It just isn't the iron-side gate for GCD-9.

### EP0 MPS reconciliation — xHCI 1.2 §4.6.7 / Linux `xhci_check_maxpacket` (Attempt 67, CLEARED HID ENUMERATION)

Diagnosis between Attempts 66 and 67: the Input Context's EP0 Max Packet Size is programmed pre-Address-Device at the speed-safe minimum (`xhci_ep0_mps_for_speed(speed)` — 8 for FS). The real `bMaxPacketSize0` returned from GDD-8 can be 8/16/32/64 for FS. Per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.7, if it differs from the stale Input-Context EP0 MPS, an Evaluate Context (TRB type 13) must update EP0 MPS *before* any wLength > MPS request. GCD-9 with stale MPS=8 multi-packets under the wrong burst size → the controller drops the second packet and the transfer event never posts. Linux reference: `xhci_check_maxpacket()` in `drivers/usb/host/xhci.c`. AMD FCH 1022:1639 enforces this strictly; QEMU's qemu-xhci is permissive on stale MPS — which is why the same binary ran end-to-end on QEMU through Attempt-65-equivalent code paths.

Repair (`+48 LOC` in `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`):

- New `xhci_evaluate_context(slot_id, input_ctx_phys)` — issues TRB type 13 (`XHCI_TRB_EVAL_CONTEXT`), waits for the Command Completion Event, returns 0 on non-success ccode with a diagnostic print.
- New reconciliation block in `xhci_enumerate_port` after GDD-8: compares `load8(xhci_desc_buf_phys + 7)` (real `bMaxPacketSize0`) vs the slot's tracked `xhci_slot_max_packet`. On mismatch, allocates an Input Context with Drop=0, Add=A0|A1 (Slot + EP0 — spec requires Slot context present even if unchanged), patches EP0 dw1 bits [31:16] with the real MPS while preserving CErr/EPType/MaxBurst in [15:0], fires `xhci_evaluate_context`, updates the tracked slot MPS.

### Result on iron post-Attempt-67

Every xhci-side command now completes on archaemenid:

```
xhci: cmd_submit#1 trb_phys=... dw3=9217           (Enable Slot ✓)
xhci: cmd_submit#2 trb_phys=... dw3=16788481       (Address Device ✓)
hid: probing iface kbd, slot=1, VID=1452 PID=591, class=0
                                                   (Evaluate Context ✓, Configure Endpoint ✓)
hid: keyboard configured, boot protocol on, EP=129, polling 8-byte reports
...
AGNOS shell v1.30.8 (type 'help')
agnos>                                              ← no echo on keystroke (Phase-5 open)
```

USBSTS stays clean across the burn (no HSE / HCE / SRE); USBCMD = R/S | INTE | HSEE; no `xhci: transfer event timeout` printed. The controller isn't reporting an error — it's just not posting Transfer Events for the interrupt-IN ring on keypress.

### Build

Kernel `build/agnos` 411,216 B (1.30.7) → **412,832 B** (1.30.8 final — version-string + RR hardening + Evaluate Context surface + MPS reconciliation block). Multiboot2 ELF64 entry preserved at `0x1000a8`. Cyrius pin 5.11.64.

### Changed

- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: **Repair RR** — `xhci_control_in` and `xhci_control_no_data` rewritten for Linux-canonical ISP + deferred-cycle Setup + full 64-bit `buf_phys` propagation. New helper `xhci_ep0_enqueue_raw`.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: **EP0 MPS reconciliation** — new `xhci_evaluate_context(slot_id, input_ctx_phys)` issuing TRB type 13. New post-GDD-8 block in `xhci_enumerate_port` per xHCI 1.2 §4.6.7 / Linux `xhci_check_maxpacket` — compares real `bMaxPacketSize0` vs the speed-safe MPS, builds Input Context with Add=A0|A1, patches EP0 dw1 [31:16] preserving CErr/EPType/MaxBurst, fires Evaluate Context, updates tracked slot MPS.

### Open carry-forward into 1.31.x

- **Phase-5 interrupt-IN keystroke delivery on iron** (the Attempt-67 blocker): keypresses on the iron keyboard produce no characters at the `agnos>` prompt despite HID configured + polling armed. Likely candidates — interrupt-IN Transfer Event not being posted by the controller on keystroke (analogous to but distinct from Phase-3 CCE silent-absorb; different ring, different doorbell), or Transfer Event posts but `xhci_handle_transfer_event` isn't decoding it into HID reports, or HID translation runs but `kb_buf` enqueue isn't reaching agnoshi's `kb_read`. QEMU is symmetric end-to-end with the same binary (sendkey → echoed input) — so iron-specific divergence sits in the interrupt-IN event-posting layer. First diagnostic step (no burn): read-only audit of AGNOS's `xhci_handle_transfer_event` vs Linux `handle_tx_event` (drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c) to confirm interrupt-IN Transfer Event decoding parity.
- **Framebuffer VGA-vs-HDMI bug** (from pre-1.30.7 iron-bring-up): different output-path behavior across display connectors on archaemenid. Repair pending.

## [1.30.7] — 2026-05-18 (Attempt 63 VISUAL BOOT-TO-SHELL ON IRON → root cause found via QEMU → TYPEABLE SHELL ON QEMU)

**The MVP closed-beta arc — visual on iron at attempt-63 cut, typeable on QEMU after root-cause analysis the same day.** 1.30.7 spans two milestones: (1) the first iron build to render `agnoshi shell v1.30.7 (type 'help')` on archaemenid's framebuffer (Attempt 63, 2026-05-18 morning); (2) end-to-end typeable shell on QEMU's qemu-xhci the same evening, after the 10-letter cmd-path silent-absorb arc (FF→QQ+QQ2) was traced to a Cyrius compiler bug, not silicon. Iron Attempt 65 with the same binary as the QEMU-validated state is pending and is the candidate for a 1.30.8 cut if iron-specific fixes surface.

**ROOT CAUSE — Cyrius gvar-init-order**: top-level `var X = INT_LITERAL ;` declarations read as 0 before module-init runs. In agnos's kmode==1 boot (per cyrius emit ordering: top-level asm → PARSE_PROG body → EMIT_GVAR_INITS), the kernel's main body lives in PARSE_PROG and never returns, so the post-PROG init block that emits gvar literal stores never executes. `XHCI_CMD_TIMEOUT_SPINS = 10000000` (`xhci_cmd.cyr:60`) read as 0 → `while (wait < 0)` exited immediately → `events_seen=0` always. `XHCI_EVT_RING_SEGMENT_SIZE = 256` (`xhci_ring.cyr:51`) read as 0 → ERST entry's Ring Segment Size word planted as 0 → controller had no event-ring slot to write Command Completion Events to. Both load-bearing. **Fixed at the language level in cyrius v5.11.64** — image-static init for literal-RHS gvars across every backend (ELF32/64-kernel/user/shared/obj, aarch64, MachO x86_64/ARM64, PE-EXEC); regression test `tests/tcyr/gvar_static_init.tcyr`. Issue: [`2026-05-18-gvar-init-order-zero-reads.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/blob/main/docs/development/issues/2026-05-18-gvar-init-order-zero-reads.md). A 2026-04-28 ticket for the related forward-ref form (`global-init-order-forward-ref.md`) had shipped a cyrlint warning at v5.7.32 but didn't fix the codegen; .64 closes the loop.

**Three agnos-side bugs surfaced via the QEMU lane** (none would have been findable on iron alone — all are virtual-controller-divergent paths that hardcoded iron's known config):

1. **xHCI BAR above 4 GB unmappable** — `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` only handled PML4[0] (sub-512 GB). QEMU's qemu-xhci BAR lands at 0xC000000000 (768 GB) under OVMF.
2. **CSZ=1 hardcoded** — `xhci_alloc_input_ctx` wrote Slot Context at offset 0x40 and EP0 Context at 0x80 (64-byte CSZ=1 layout). QEMU's qemu-xhci has CSZ=0 (32-byte contexts) → controller read Slot Context at 0x20 (all zeros) → Address Device returned ccode=5 (TRB Error). Iron is CSZ=1 so was always working; QEMU surfaced the latent assumption.
3. **Add Flags carry-forward** — `xhci_input_ctx_add_interrupt_in` OR'd new Add bits onto the stale A1 (EP0) flag set by `xhci_alloc_input_ctx`. Configure Endpoint with A1=1 told HW to reload EP0 from the Input Context's stale EP0 (TR Dequeue Pointer untouched since Address Device, while Device Context EP0 had advanced through Get Device Descriptor traffic) → ccode=5 (TRB Error). Linux `xhci_init_input_control_ctx` convention is to set Add Flags = A0 | A_new only.

**xHCI cmd-path status after the fixes (QEMU + agnos@HEAD, validated 2026-05-18)**:
- Enable Slot → CCE arrives, slot 1 assigned ✓
- Address Device → CCE arrives, device addressed ✓
- Get Device Descriptor → 18 bytes returned, `VID=1575 PID=1 class=0` (QEMU usb-kbd) ✓
- Configure Endpoint → CCE arrives, EP3 interrupt-IN configured ✓
- Keyboard ringing doorbell, `hid: keyboard configured, boot protocol on, EP=129, polling 8-byte reports` ✓
- QEMU `sendkey h e l p ret` → `agnos> help` echo + full command output ✓
- QEMU `sendkey u p t i m e ret` → `agnos> uptime` → `2216 ticks` ✓

**Iron implications (untested)**: iron has CSZ=1 → CSZ-aware helpers compute the same 64-byte offsets that were previously hardcoded (no regression). The Add Flags fix is universal. The gvar fix is compiler-level and universal. The BAR-above-4GB fix is a no-op on iron's sub-4GB BAR. **Iron Attempt 65 is the next validation step**; if it reaches typeable shell on archaemenid the MVP closed-beta gate hits end-to-end on real hardware. If iron-specific fixes surface, those land in a 1.30.8 cut.

**Letter-ladder retrospective** (FF→GG→HH→JJ→KK→LL→MM→NN→OO→QQ+QQ2 — ten falsified silicon-quirk hypotheses across Attempts 57-63): all were red herrings; none could have been correct because the bug was compile-time, not runtime. Per `feedback_known_knowledge_first` and `feedback_stop_letter_laddering`, the lesson is that compiler-class bugs need to be on the suspect list earlier when symptom + spec + 4-source-prior-art diff all conflict. The QEMU lane was the unlock — same `events_seen=0` symptom on a completely different controller (qemu-xhci, csz=0, no USBLEGSUP, no scratchpad bufs, BAR at 768 GB) proved silicon couldn't be the cause. **A pre-existing suspicion comment at `xhci_cmd.cyr:107-115` had named "gvar-init-order: `XHCI_DIAG_SUBMIT_MAX` reading 0 at first-call time"** as the hypothesis back at Attempt 58 — but the consumer-side workaround there masked the load-bearing register-write case for another five attempts.

Iron-side narrative + boot-log read for Attempts 56–63 in [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md) § Attempts 56–64.

### Changed

- `VERSION`: 1.30.6 → 1.30.7
- `kernel/version.cyr`: kernel banner, shell banner, `_AGNOS_VERSION` bumped to 1.30.7
- `cyrius.cyml`: cyrius pin **5.11.59 → 5.11.64** (gvar-init-order fix; image-static init for literal-RHS gvars)
- `kernel/core/vmm.cyr`: `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` extended to handle `phys ≥ 512 GB` (PML4[N>0]). Allocates a fresh PDPT under the target PML4 entry if absent, zero-fills it, installs at PML4 with P|RW, then shatters the 1 GB region into 2 MB entries with the target chunk marked UC. Sub-1 GB and 1–512 GB paths unchanged.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: removed the `mmio >= 0x100000000` early-out gate (was a "deferred until iron evidence" placeholder); `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` now handles every BAR location generically. EP0 TR Dequeue Pointer readback at line 1036 (formerly `load64(ictx + 0x88)`) made CSZ-aware via `xhci_ep0_ctx_off() + 8`.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: **Repair OO.B reverted** — IMAN.IE write moved from post-R/S=1 back to pre-R/S=1 (right after ERSTBA), matching 3-of-4 convergent prior art (FreeBSD `xhci.c:1512-5`, Haiku `xhci.cpp:1773`, EDK2 `XhciSched.c:1184-6`) plus OVMF empirical reference in QEMU traces. Linux's xhci_run_finished post-R/S convention is the outlier; works on Linux's test surface but doesn't on AMD FCH 1022:1639 or qemu-xhci which latch interrupter config at R/S transition.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ctx.cyr`: added CSZ-aware helpers `xhci_ctx_size()` / `xhci_slot_ctx_off()` / `xhci_ep0_ctx_off()` / `xhci_ep_ctx_off(dci)` returning 32 or 64 based on `HCCPARAMS1.CSZ`. All hardcoded Slot Context (0x40), EP0 Context (0x80), and EP[N] (`(dci+1) * 0x40`) offsets across `xhci_alloc_input_ctx` and `xhci_input_ctx_add_interrupt_in` substituted to use the helpers.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ctx.cyr`: `xhci_input_ctx_add_interrupt_in` Add Flags computation changed from `add_flags |= (1 << dci) | 0x1` to `store32(ictx_phys + 4, (1 << dci) | 0x1)` — drops the stale A1 (EP0) flag carried from `xhci_alloc_input_ctx` initial setup. Matches Linux `xhci_init_input_control_ctx` convention.

### Notes

- No code change from 1.30.6 — same `pci_enable_msix_unmasked` + `xhci_start` surface. Banner-only release for the iron-validation receipt.
- Next-move options under user review: (PP) UC-remap DMA regions; (QQ3) Linux-style per-vector MSI-X programming across all N vectors; (Phase-4/5-software) xHCI 1.2 §4.6 audit on whether Enable Slot is normatively required for HID enumeration; (decouple) Phase 4/5 to QEMU code-completion.

## [1.30.6] — 2026-05-18 (xHCI cmd-path arc — FF through QQ; MSI-X table programming closeout)

**Phase 4 Enable Slot `events_seen=0` opened the cmd-path silent-absorb arc; 1.30.6 bundles the full repair surface as code.** 1.30.5 closed the Phase 3 silent-absorb arc with Repair (EE) after 13 falsified hypotheses; 1.30.6 opens the Phase 4 cmd-path arc with Repair (FF) and accumulates ten subsequent behavioral repairs (GG, HH, JJ, KK, LL, MM, NN, OO, QQ + QQ'') as the four-source convergent-prior-art audit (Linux + FreeBSD + Haiku + EDK2 — see [`xhci-prior-art-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/xhci-prior-art-audit.md)) narrows the gate. As of the 1.30.6 cut: FF through OO burned and falsified across Attempts 57-62; QQ + QQ'' (MSI-X Table vector-0 programming) staged-not-yet-burned. Per the iron-bring-up convention, code lands in the release regardless of iron validation; iron resolution moves separately in [`iron-nuc-zen-log.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md). Bottoming-out path if QQ falsifies: Repair (PP) UC-remap of DMA regions (event ring + cmd ring + DCBAA + scratchpad), pre-staged but not auto-applied; otherwise decouple Phase 4/5 to QEMU code-completion. **The whole arc bundles under one 1.30.6 banner** per the user's 2026-05-18 cycle directive ("I really don't care what fixes it I want it fixed... hardening and cleanup can always be done later") — no per-repair point release.

### The opening narrative — Repair (FF) and the events_seen=0 discovery

Attempt 56 burn (2026-05-17, archaemenid AMD Renoir 1022:1639) was the read-only event-ring-state instrumentation cut queued in the 1.30.5 working tree. FB output:

```
xhci: enable_slot entry idx=1 cycle=1
xhci: cmd completion timeout, final_idx=1 cycle=1 events_seen=0
```

`events_seen=0` over the full `XHCI_CMD_TIMEOUT_SPINS` (~250 ms) window following the Enable Slot doorbell, combined with `xhci: drained 0 events` from the pre-PR drain, meant the controller never wrote a single event to the event ring after R/S=1. The event ring infrastructure itself was programmed correctly (ERSTSZ=1, ERSTBA=erst_phys, ERDP=evt_ring_phys, CRCR pointer + RCS=1 ordering all clean per audit), but the interrupter appeared disabled.

Initial hypothesis (Repair FF): `xhci_start` wrote `IMAN = 0x1` (IP clear, **IE=0**) with a deliberate "IMAN.IE stays 0 — poll mode for MVP" comment. xHCI 1.2 §4.17 reads "Software shall set the IE flag to '1' for all Interrupters that it intends to use" — and Linux's `xhci-mem.c` sets IE=1 unconditionally. One-line fix at `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr:541`: `IMAN = 0x3` (IP=W1C clear + IE=1). **Attempt 57 falsified this as the unblock for Enable Slot specifically** — Attempt 58 then proved (via the GG+EditA+EditB bundle) that *some* events post (`drained 1 events`), narrowing the gate to "Enable Slot CCE silent-absorb" rather than "entire event ring silent." The arc opened from there. FF stayed in the code (spec-correct, Linux-aligned); subsequent repairs targeted the increasingly narrow cmd-path-specific gate.

### Added

- **Repair (FF)** 2026-05-17 — `xhci_start` writes `IMAN = 0x3` (IP=W1C clear + IE=1) instead of `IMAN = 0x1`. xHCI 1.2 §4.17 + Linux `xhci-mem.c` convention; AMD FCH 1022:1639 silicon-spec alignment. One-line behavioral change at `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr:541`. **Attempt 57 outcome**: `events_seen=0` survived — IMAN.IE=1 alone did not unblock Enable Slot CCE posting (though it likely contributed to general event posting per Attempt 58's drained-1 evidence). FF stays in code as spec-correct baseline.

- **Repair (GG)** 2026-05-17 — AMD-Vi global IOMMU disable for AMD Renoir 1022:1639. `amd_iommu_disable()` at `kernel/arch/x86_64/iommu.cyr:269-317` walks PCI 0:0.2 cap list for ID `0x0F` (Secure Device), confirms cap type bits [18:16]==`0x3` (IOMMU), maps MMIO base UC, writes IOMMU Control Register at MMIO+0x18 = 0 (passthrough). Called from `kernel/core/main.cyr:155` after `pci_scan()` and before `xhci_probe()`. Intel boxes no-op. **Attempt 58 outcome**: FB confirms `amdvi: cap@64 mmio=4247781376 en=1` + `amdvi: disabled, ctrl_rb=0` — AMD-Vi *was* firmware-enabled, GG wrote successfully — but `events_seen=0` persists for Enable Slot. Strongest "platform-side DMA gating" candidate eliminated. Proper passthrough / DTE setup deferred to v6.x.

- **Repair (HH)** 2026-05-17 — Post-doorbell-write `load32` readback flush in `xhci_cmd_submit` (`xhci_cmd.cyr:130-131`). Matches Linux `xhci_ring_cmd_db` (`xhci-ring.c`) `writel(DB_VALUE_HOST, dba); readl(dba);` convention against AMD-FCH host-bridge posted-write deferral. **Attempt 60 outcome**: applied as part of HH/JJ/KK/LL stack; `events_seen=0` persists — doorbell-flush hypothesis closed.

- **Repair (JJ)** 2026-05-17 — Universal `load32` readback flush on every operational + runtime register write. `xhci_op_write32`, `xhci_op_write64`, `xhci_rt_write32`, `xhci_rt_write64` in `xhci.cyr:354-391` each do `store…; var flush = load32(addr);`. Matches Linux's `writel + readl` universal convention across CRCR / DCBAAP / ERSTBA / ERSTSZ / ERDP / IMAN / USBCMD / CONFIG. **Attempt 60 outcome**: `events_seen=0` persists — host-bridge posted-write deferral hypothesis closed across the entire operational + runtime register surface.

- **Repair (KK)** 2026-05-17 — CNR (Controller Not Ready, USBSTS bit 11) poll before any operational-register writes in `xhci_start`. `xhci.cyr:540-559`. Matches Linux `xhci_init` → `xhci_handshake(STS_CNR, 0, …)`. **Attempt 60 outcome**: no `xhci: CNR never cleared` line on FB → CNR was clear at the poll's first iteration; post-reset CNR re-assert hypothesis closed for this silicon.

- **Repair (LL)** 2026-05-17 — Link TRB initial cycle bit fix in `xhci_rings_init` (`xhci_ring.cyr:179-192`) — removed `| 0x1` from initial Link TRB write per xHCI 1.2 §4.9.3.1 (C bit starts opposite of PCS=1). Defensive correctness for ring-wrap; first Enable Slot doesn't traverse Link TRB so LL doesn't gate the symptom but stays as spec correctness.

- **Repair (MM)** 2026-05-17 — PCI MSI-X Function Mask cleared, Enable=1. New `pci_enable_msix_unmasked` at `kernel/core/pci.cyr:216-241`; call-site swap in `xhci.cyr` (was `pci_enable_msix_masked`). FB literal: `xhci: MSI-X enabled (no function-mask)`. Matches Linux `pci_alloc_irq_vectors` posture (Function Mask = 0 post-init). Per-vector mask defaults to 1 (PCI 3.0 §6.8.2.5.3) so spurious MSI-X messages stay suppressed. Hypothesis: AMD FCH 1022:1639 interprets Function Mask as a stronger gate than PCI spec implies (suppressing internal interrupter state-machine progress on top of message TX suppression). **Attempt 61 outcome**: `events_seen=0` persists — Function Mask hypothesis closed.

- **Repair (NN)** 2026-05-18 — Two-LOC reorder in `xhci.cyr` per four-source convergent prior-art audit ([`xhci-prior-art-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/xhci-prior-art-audit.md)). (NN.A) `xhci_start` interrupter-setup writes ERDP before ERSTBA per xHCI 1.2 §5.5.2.3.3 + 3-of-4 prior-art convergence (FreeBSD `xhci.c:1505-9`, Haiku `xhci.cpp:1744-9`, EDK2 `XhciSched.c:2651-9`); (NN.B) CRCR moved to after IMOD per 2-of-4 prior-art convergence (FreeBSD `xhci.c:1517-23`, Haiku `xhci.cpp:1756-7`). Zero-risk hygiene; spec-strict. **Attempt 62 outcome (bundled with OO)**: `events_seen=0` persists — both reorderings were zero-risk hygiene that did not address the gate. Stays in code as spec-correct convergent-prior-art alignment.

- **Repair (OO)** 2026-05-18 — Tier 2 convergent-prior-art bundle, four sub-repairs in `xhci.cyr` + `xhci_cmd.cyr`. (OO.A) USBSTS RW1C-clear at `xhci_start` entry (FreeBSD `xhci.c:1463-66` pattern); (OO.B) IMAN.IE write moved to AFTER R/S=1 (Linux `xhci.c:1145-7` convention; reverses Repair FF's pre-R/S placement); (OO.C) explicit `mfence` before doorbell write; (OO.D) cmd-ring TRB readback flush. **Attempt 62 outcome**: bundled with NN, `events_seen=0` persists. None of A/B/C/D unblocked. Stays as Linux-convention-aligned baseline.

- **Repair (QQ + QQ'')** 2026-05-18 — MSI-X Table vector-0 programming + Linux's MaskAll-then-table-then-clear-MaskAll ordering. MSI-X audit ([iron-nuc-zen-log § Attempt 63 prep](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md)) found AGNOS never wrote the MSI-X Table — every vector's Address/Data/Vector Control was at reset (Address=0, Data=0, Vector Control=1 by reset per PCI 3.0 §6.8.2.5.3), while Linux's `msix_capability_init` populates Address/Data for every claimed vector BEFORE clearing FuncMask. Hypothesis: AMD FCH 1022:1639's interrupter state machine gates event posting on a configured (non-zero Address) table. Edits: `kernel/core/pci.cyr` extends `pci_enable_msix_unmasked` with three-phase ordering — **Phase 1**: Enable+FuncMask=1 (MaskAll-during-init window); **Phase 2**: read Table Offset/BIR from cap+0x04, compute `table_phys = BAR(BIR) + offset`, write vector 0's Address Lo = 0xFEE00000 (BSP LAPIC, dest CPU 0, physical mode) + Address Hi = 0 + Data = 0x40 (vector 0x40, Fixed delivery, Edge trigger) + Vector Control = 1 (mask preserved — AGNOS polls, no ISR plumbing required), readback flush; **Phase 3**: clear FuncMask. `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`: MSI-X enable call reordered to AFTER `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` so table writes hit the UC-remapped BAR chunk (mandatory — pre-Repair-X PORTSC silent-absorb-in-WB hazard otherwise). Build: 368,568 → **368,968 B** (+400 B). **First repair in the arc tied to a direct, named, Linux-implicit divergence** (not a spec-path reorder). Confidence: medium-high. Vendor-cap audit confirmed Linux applies no `1022:1639`-gated quirk to the cold-boot Enable Slot path (dry well); BAR memtype audit confirmed AGNOS matches `ioremap_uc()` semantics (PWT=1+PCD=1+PAT=0 → PAT entry 3 = strict UC under firmware PAT MSR `0x0007040600070406`). Staged for Attempt 63 iron burn.

- **Edit A** 2026-05-17 — read-only CRCR.CRR / ERSTSZ / IMAN / ERDP readback after `xhci_start` completes the R/S=1 + HCH=0 wait (`xhci.cyr:583-603`). Single FB line: `xhci: CRCR.CRR=<N> ERSTSZ=<N> IMAN=<N> ERDP_lo=<N>`. **Attempt 58 outcome**: `CRCR.CRR=0 ERSTSZ=1 IMAN=2 ERDP_lo=5672968`. IMAN=2 (IE=1 + IP=W1C-cleared) formally confirms FF stuck. ERSTSZ=1 + ERDP_lo=`0x569008` (page-aligned `0x569000` + EHB bit 3 set by HW) prove ring infrastructure is good and HW touched the event handler. CRCR.CRR=0 is spec-ambiguous pre-doorbell.

- **Edit B** 2026-05-17 — read-only per-submit TRB phys + dw3 readback in `xhci_cmd_submit` (`xhci_cmd.cyr:53-54, 99-109`), bounded to 2 submissions via `XHCI_DIAG_SUBMIT_MAX`. FB line: `xhci: cmd_submit#<N> trb_phys=<P> dw3=<D>`. Verifies (a) TRB landed at the address HW will fetch from and (b) the cycle bit + TRB type were stored correctly. **Attempt 58 outcome**: print line MISSING from FB due to stale USB build (Edit B in commit `0e3d01a` at 20:21; `build/agnos` was timestamped 20:20; USB flashed pre-commit). Root-cause established the `feedback_build_freshness_is_mine` discipline.

### Iron status (Attempts 56 — 62, archaemenid AMD Renoir 1022:1639)

- **Attempt 56** (2026-05-17): event-ring-state instrumentation cut. `events_seen=0` discovered as the cmd-path gate. Triage class 3 (event polling vs PSC posting) falsified — no events on ring at all.
- **Attempt 57** (2026-05-17, FF): `events_seen=0` survived IMAN.IE=1. Search class narrowed from "event posting infrastructure" to "platform- or cmd-ring-side gating."
- **Attempt 58** (2026-05-17, GG + Edits A+B): **Breakthrough — `xhci: drained 1 events` (was 0 in 56/57) + EHB=1 in ERDP_lo prove HW *is* posting events to the ring.** Either FF or GG was the unblock for general posting (the two were bundled — decoupling burn deprioritized as low-info vs cost). The gate narrowed to "Enable Slot specifically produces no CMD_COMPLETION event."
- **Attempts 59-60** (2026-05-17, HH/JJ/KK/LL stack): all four falsified. `events_seen=0` persists.
- **Attempt 61** (2026-05-18, MM): MSI-X Function Mask clear — falsified.
- **Attempt 62** (2026-05-18, NN+OO bundled): four-source convergent prior-art reorders (NN.A/B) + Tier 2 bundle (OO.A/B/C/D) — all falsified. 9-letter ladder closed at OO; `feedback_stop_letter_laddering` triggered.
- **Vendor-cap audit** (2026-05-18, 0 burns): Linux applies exactly one `1022:1639`-gated quirk (`XHCI_BROKEN_D3COLD_S2I`), irrelevant to cold-boot Enable Slot. `drivers/usb/host/xhci-ring.c` `handle_cmd_completion` / `queue_command` / `xhci_ring_cmd_db` contain no AMD-gated branches. FreeBSD `xhci_pci_attach` applies zero AMD errata for `0x1639`. **Dry well — no Repair (QQ) candidate from Linux quirks.**
- **MSI-X table + BAR memtype audit** (2026-05-18, 0 burns, parallel): MSI-X table never programmed — DIVERGENCE FOUND (Repair QQ candidate). BAR memtype matches `ioremap_uc()` strict UC — CLEAN.
- **Attempt 63 (QQ + QQ'')** staged 2026-05-18: build verified 368,968 B; pending iron burn.
- **Phase 3 reset on port 3**: still UNBLOCKED across Attempts 55-62 (Repair EE intact across two minors running).
- **CMOS slot integrity** (archaemenid CMOS map): `[0x86]=0x5A` / `[0x87]=0xA5` corruption confirms those slots are not in virgin-scratch zone (0x50-0x7F). AA (0x81) / BB (0x84) sentinels intact — 0x80-0x84 band confirmed reliable scratch on AMD FCH 1022:1639.

### Process

- **Build freshness ownership** clarified mid-Attempt-58: kernel build freshness during iron-boot bring-up is Claude's responsibility (`feedback_bootloader_kernel_ownership`, `feedback_build_freshness_is_mine`). User owns `install-usb.sh --update`; Claude rebuilds + verifies before declaring next-burn-ready. Cost of un-clarified ownership: one half-instrumented iron burn (Attempt 58, pre-commit USB).
- **Letter-laddering escape plan** (`feedback_stop_letter_laddering`): at 9 letters deep (FF→OO) the escape plan crystallized as the load-bearing artifact, not the next letter. Two read-only audits (vendor-cap, MSI-X+BAR memtype) ran in lieu of stacking Repair (PP) on iron. The MSI-X audit surfaced QQ; the BAR memtype audit confirmed AGNOS exceeds Linux semantics. Documented in [iron-nuc-zen-log § Attempt 62 final entry](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).
- **Single-repair-per-burn discipline suspended** for the cmd-path arc (user directive 2026-05-18): "I really don't care what fixes it I want it fixed... hardening and cleanup can always be done later." Multi-repair bundles permitted (NN+OO bundled at Attempt 62; QQ + QQ'' bundled in this cut). Instrumentation discipline (`feedback_no_instrumentation_means_no_instrumentation`) remains in force — no kprintlns added in NN/OO/QQ.
- **Convergent-prior-art audit** as a pattern (new this cycle): when symptom-dictionary letter-laddering hits 5-6 deep on the same root, write a baseline-diff doc against ≥3 independent reference impls. Was missing through FF/GG/HH/JJ/KK/LL/MM; would have collapsed those into a single bundle. Pattern documented at [`xhci-prior-art-audit.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/xhci-prior-art-audit.md).

## [1.30.5] — 2026-05-17 (Repair EE — xHCI silent-absorb arc closed; Phase 4 + Phase 5 HID keyboard driver landed)

**The 13-hypothesis xHCI silent-absorb arc closed as a homegrown bug, not
silicon.** Five days of per-bit spec audit across Attempts 32-54 chased a
"controller absorbs PORTSC.PR writes" hypothesis through cache attributes,
PML4 walks, scratchpad install, DNCTRL, event-ring drain, timing delays,
and per-port SupProto fingerprints. Root cause surfaced via prior-art
diff against EDK2 `XhciDxe` (`XhciPortReset`) and Linux `xhci-hub.c`
(`xhci_set_port_reset`): both write `portsc | PR` without re-masking.
AGNOS's `xhci_portsc_write` (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr:464`)
was applying an inner `& XHCI_PORTSC_NEUTRAL` mask before the OR-in of
W1C bits — and `PR` (bit 4) is RW1S, *outside* `NEUTRAL` — so every
port-reset write across the entire arc had its PR bit silently stripped
before `store32` hit the controller. "Silent-absorb" was real; the
absorber was AGNOS's own helper, not silicon. One-line fix removed the
inner re-mask. Cyrius pin bumped 5.11.55 → 5.11.59 in the same commit.

**Iron evidence** (Attempt 55, archaemenid AMD Renoir 1022:1639): for the
first time across 13 attempts, `CMOS[0x64]` reports a non-zero
reset-OK bitmap (`0x04` = port 3 reset succeeded; Keychron K2 on port 3
of the USB2 bank). FB shows no `xhci: port 3 reset failed (proto=2)`
line — Phase 3 enumeration now reaches the Enable Slot command for the
first time. Per-attempt + CMOS-table detail in [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 55](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).

**Bundled in 1.30.5**: Phase 4 + Phase 5 of the USB HID-boot keyboard
driver, completing the boot-to-typeable-shell code surface. Phase 4
(`hid_kbd_configure`): Get Configuration Descriptor + walk for the
HID-boot-keyboard interface + Configure Endpoint TRB (type 12) +
`SET_PROTOCOL=boot` + interrupt-IN transfer ring construction. Phase 5
(`hid_poll` + translation): event-ring drain on the keyboard endpoint +
HID-usage → PS/2 set-1 scancode translation table + report differ
(press/release inference between consecutive 8-byte HID reports) +
`kb_buf` writer routing through the existing `scancode_to_ascii` path so
the shell sees keys via the same buffer that the legacy PS/2 path used.
Code surface: 2 new files (`hid_kbd.cyr`, `hid_translate.cyr`) +
extensions to `xhci.cyr` / `xhci_cmd.cyr` / `kb.cyr` / `main.cyr`;
~600 LOC. Validation surface is QEMU `xhci-pci` (spec-compliant
controller); Phase 4/5 stay dormant on iron until the Phase 4 Enable
Slot ccode=0 gate (Attempt 55's new gate, downstream of the EE
unblock) clears.

### Added

- **Repair (EE)** — `xhci_portsc_write` no longer applies `& XHCI_PORTSC_NEUTRAL`
  to `value` inside the helper; caller is responsible for the OR-in mask
  per EDK2 + Linux convention. (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`)
- **`hid_kbd.cyr`** — USB HID-boot keyboard driver. `hid_kbd_init`,
  `hid_kbd_configure` (Get Configuration Descriptor + interface walk +
  Configure Endpoint TRB + SET_PROTOCOL=boot + transfer ring),
  `hid_poll` (event-ring drain on kbd EP, report differ, scancode
  emission).
- **`hid_translate.cyr`** — HID-usage → PS/2 set-1 translation table.
  ASCII-printable + arrow + modifier coverage matching the existing
  `scancode_to_ascii` path; boot-protocol-only (full HID report
  descriptor parsing deferred).
- **xHCI cmd-ring extensions** — `xhci_cmd_submit` + `xhci_cmd_wait`
  generalized to handle Configure Endpoint TRB; `xhci_set_protocol`
  helper for the USB HID class-specific request.
- **`kb.cyr` integration** — `kb_has_key()` now also drives `hid_poll()`
  on every shell-tick; structurally inert when `hid_kbd_slot_id == 0`
  (no HID keyboard configured), so safe on hardware where Phase 4
  hasn't run yet.

### Changed

- **`cyrius.cyml`** — toolchain pin bumped 5.11.55 → 5.11.59 alongside
  the EE one-liner. Matches kriya 0.6.0's parallel-M5 pin bump.

### Iron status

- **Phase 3** (port reset) unblocked on archaemenid USB2 bank port 3.
  Silent-absorb arc closed at 13 falsified hypotheses + EE-confirmed.
- **Phase 4** (Enable Slot command-ring round-trip) is the new iron-side
  gate. FB on Attempt 55 reads `kbd: Enable Slot failed, ccode=0` →
  `xhci: enumeration timeout` (`ccode=0` is the default of
  `xhci_last_cmd_ccode`, surfacing when `xhci_cmd_wait` times out
  without consuming a matching Command Completion Event). Triage
  classes in [`iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § Attempt 55](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md);
  Attempt 56 read-only event-ring instrumentation queued in working
  tree (1.30.6 staging).
- **Phase 4/5** code surface validated on QEMU `xhci-pci` (spec-compliant
  controller, Phase 3 completes end-to-end, Phase 4 reaches Configure
  Endpoint, Phase 5 drains keyboard reports). Dormant on archaemenid
  until Phase 4 gate clears.

## [1.30.4] — 2026-05-17 (xHCI Linux-diff hardening closeout)

**xHCI Phase 3 silent-absorb arc continues — Repair (BB) Device Notification
Control + audit-driven follow-ups (stamp redesigns, double xfer-ring leak)
+ Phase 4/5 development lanes opening in parallel.** Attempt 50 burn
(2026-05-17) confirmed Repair (AA) scratchpad install ran cleanly per FB
(`scratchpad ready` + `controller running`) but silent-absorb on USB2
ports 1+3 survived → AA falsified, tenth hypothesis in the arc. Same-session
audit of `agnos/kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/` (TODO / stub / silent-success
patterns) surfaced **DNCTRL (op_reg 0x14) defined at `xhci_regs.cyr:70` but
never written** — exact AA precedent (constant known, write step skipped).
WebFetch of Linux `drivers/usb/host/xhci.c` confirmed `xhci_set_dev_notifications`
writes `DEV_NOTE_FWAKE = 0x02` to op_regs+0x14 during `xhci_init()`
unconditionally before R/S=1. Hypothesis: some USB2 port-link-state
transitions on AMD Renoir/Cezanne (1022:1639) are gated on notification
handling being enabled. Audit also found a real but post-Phase-3 memory
leak (double xfer-ring allocation in `xhci_enumerate_port`) and two CMOS
stamp design flaws from Attempt 50 (`[0x83]` captures page-aligned phys
low byte = always 0x00; `[0x80]=53` vs `[0x82]=0` inconsistency from
unobserved hcsp2 byte 2). **Attempt 51 burn (2026-05-17) — BB falsified**
empirically: FB line `xhci: dev_notifications enabled` rendered, `port 1
reset failed (proto=2)` + `port 3 reset failed (proto=2)` followed.
Eleventh hypothesis in the arc. Post-mortem readback also exposed a
foundational **CMOS-alias bug** — slots ≥ 0x80 written via the legacy
`0x70/0x71` port pair had been silently aliasing to RTC time-of-day
registers (port 0x70 bit 7 is the NMI mask, not a slot-index bit), so the
entire AA + BB diagnostic capture at `[0x80]/[0x82]/[0x84]` was returning
BCD wall-clock seconds/minutes/hours rather than the kernel's intended
bytes. Slots `[0x81]/[0x83]/[0x85]` aliased to RTC alarm regs (rarely
touched scratch), preserving kernel writes and masking the bug across
both attempts. Repairs (CC) + (DD) land in the same staging cycle:
extended-CMOS routing through 0x72/0x73 for slots ≥ 0x80, and event-ring
drain + USBSTS.PCD clear before each port-reset PR write (USBSTS PCD=1
across the silent-absorb arc was a signal AGNOS never acknowledged; the
twelfth hypothesis). **Attempt 52 iron burn (2026-05-17) — Row 2 / DD falsified;
twelfth hypothesis exhausted.** FB rendered `xhci: drained 1 events` +
`port 1/3 reset failed` — DD site executed cleanly (1 real firmware-residue
event consumed) but silent-absorb persists. Post-Attempt-52 handoff /
AMD-quirk audit (Linux `xhci-pci.c` AMD-Renoir quirk paths +
`pci-quirks.c` `usb_amd_quirk_pll` chipset detection) confirmed no
Renoir-specific cold-boot workarounds AGNOS misses. **Decoupling decision
activates as written**: xHCI silent-absorb arc closes as "non-spec gate,
parallel-track only"; no Attempt 53 without explicit new-burn
authorization. 1.30.4 closes with **xHCI Linux-diff hardening (H1-H4)**
as the spec-discipline closeout contribution (~10 LOC, all audit-verified
non-silent-absorb gates). Phase 4 (Configure Endpoint + SET_PROTOCOL=boot)
+ Phase 5 (HID translation + `kb_buf` feed) move from "shovel-ready
plan" to active work in 1.30.5+.

### Added

- **Repair (BB) Device Notification Control write** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  ~3 LOC in `xhci_init()` after the CNR-clear wait, before `xhci_halted`
  flip: `xhci_op_write32(XHCI_OP_DNCTRL, 0x02)` enables N1 Function Wake
  notifications per xHCI 1.2 §5.4.4. Stamp sentinel `CMOS[0x84]=0xBB`
  proves the site executed (survives kybernet kcp overwrite). FB line
  `xhci: dev_notifications enabled` between `CNR never cleared` guard
  and `halted, reset clean`. Hypothesis under test: same-shape Linux-diff
  to AA (register defined, write step missing) — eleventh in the
  silent-absorb arc.
- **CMOS [0x85] HCSPARAMS2 byte 2 cross-check stamp** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  Captures `(hcsp2 >> 16) & 0xFF` alongside the existing `[0x82]` byte-3
  stamp. Disambiguates Attempt 50's `[0x80]=53` vs `[0x82]=0x00`
  mathematical impossibility (per AGNOS decode `(bits 25:21 << 5) | bits
  31:27` with `[0x82]=0` constraining count ≤ 7). **Post-Attempt-51
  finding**: the `[0x80]=53` mystery was the CMOS-alias bug all along —
  53 was RTC seconds at read time, not MaxScratchpadBufs. The byte-2
  cross-check survives as defense-in-depth once CC routes the slots
  correctly.
- **Repair (CC) extended-CMOS routing for slots ≥ 0x80**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr` `xhci_cmos_stamp`; mirror in
  `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` `cmos_read`). Splits on
  slot 0x80: slots < 0x80 keep the legacy 0x70/0x71 path; slots ≥ 0x80
  route through the extended CMOS bank at 0x72/0x73 (offset = slot −
  0x80, no NMI-mask bit collision). Root cause for Attempts 50+51
  capture corruption: `outb(0x70, 0x84)` clears bit 7 = NMI mask and
  selects slot 0x04 (RTC hours), so the entire `[0x80]/[0x82]/[0x84]`
  AA + BB diagnostic surface had been reading RTC time-of-day BCD. The
  RTC alarm registers at indices 0x01/0x03/0x05 are unused scratch on
  archaemenid's AMD FCH, which preserved the kernel writes at
  `[0x81]/[0x83]/[0x85]` and masked the bug across both burns. Empirical
  sentinel `xhci_cmos_stamp(0x86, 0xCC)` in `xhci.cyr` (after the BB
  stamp) verifies the AMD FCH 1022:1639 honors the 0x72/0x73 port pair;
  `[0x86]=0xCC` on next iron read → extended CMOS live, anything else
  → fall back to FB-only diagnostics for the >0x7F range.
- **Repair (DD) event-ring drain + USBSTS.PCD clear before port reset**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr` new
  `xhci_drain_port_change_events`, called from `xhci_port_reset` USB2
  path after Repair (Z) 10 ms timing delay and before the first
  PORTSC.PR write). Walks event TRBs from `xhci_evt_ring_idx` while the
  cycle bit matches `xhci_evt_ring_cycle`, advances the dequeue pointer
  with EHB (bit 3) set on the ERDP write-back, then RW1C-clears
  USBSTS.PCD via `xhci_op_write32(XHCI_OP_USBSTS, 0x10)`. 64-TRB safety
  bound prevents runaway on a corrupted cycle bit. Hypothesis under
  test: AMD FCH 1022:1639 gates further PORTSC writes (silent absorb)
  until prior Port Status Change events are consumed and PCD is
  cleared. Attempt 51 [0x77]=0x10 (USBSTS.PCD=1) was direct evidence
  the controller had a pending change event sitting un-acknowledged
  across the entire silent-absorb arc; Linux's `xhci-hub.c` drains
  events between port operations via `xhci_handle_event` from
  `xhci_hub_status_data`, but AGNOS only drained from EP0 doorbell
  completions (post-reset, too late). Sentinel `[0x87]=0xDD` + FB line
  `xhci: drained N events`. Twelfth hypothesis in the silent-absorb
  arc; first one to act directly on a USBSTS bit AGNOS had been
  observing but never acknowledging.

#### xHCI Linux-diff hardening (H1-H4) — 1.30.4 closeout, 2026-05-17

Four spec deviations from Linux's `drivers/usb/host/xhci.c` init sequence,
surfaced by the pre-Attempt-52 connectivity audit. **None are silent-absorb
gates** (audit-verified, structurally inert under current iron evidence);
each is a real spec gap closed before public-beta. Total ~10 LOC.

- **H1 — `XHCI_OP_PAGESIZE` 4 KB assertion** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ring.cyr`).
  xHCI 1.2 §5.4.3. Scratchpad alloc path now reads PAGESIZE op-reg before
  `pmm_alloc` and bails with `xhci: PAGESIZE rejects 4KB, bitmap=N` if bit
  0 is clear. All contemporary x86_64 silicon advertises 4 KB; the
  assertion guards against silicon that requires larger pages from
  silently mis-sizing scratchpad buffers.
- **H2 — `XHCI_IR_IMAN.IP` RW1C clear in `xhci_start`** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  xHCI 1.2 §5.5.2.1. After the ERDP write, `IMAN |= 0x1` clears any
  Interrupt Pending bit left over from BIOS/firmware that would otherwise
  inhibit a fresh edge-triggered interrupt assertion when MSI-X lands.
  IMAN.IE (bit 1) stays 0 — poll mode for MVP.
- **H3 — `XHCI_IR_IMOD` 250 µs interrupt moderation** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  xHCI 1.2 §5.5.2.2. Same block as H2. Writes `0x000003E8` (1000 × 250 ns
  = 250 µs moderation). HW default is 0 (no moderation) which under
  MSI/MSI-X would risk interrupt storms. Safe under poll mode; matches
  Linux's default.
- **H4 — `USBCMD.HSEE` bit 3 in start mask** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  xHCI 1.2 §5.4.1.4. Start mask widened from `0x05` (R/S | INTE) to
  `0x0D` (R/S | INTE | HSEE) so any subsequent Host System Error sets
  `USBSTS.HSE` *and* asserts the interrupter. Without HSEE an HSE would
  go unreported — fail-silent regression risk.

### Changed

- **CMOS [0x83] stamp redesign** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_ring.cyr`).
  Now captures `(sp_array >> 16) & 0xFF` instead of `sp_array & 0xFF`.
  Page-aligned phys is structurally `& 0xFF == 0` (4 KB alignment),
  which made the original Attempt 50 outcome matrix's Row 1 vs Row 4
  distinction broken (`[0x83]==0` was supposed to mean alloc-failed but
  ran also on success). Byte 2 is non-zero for any phys ≥ 64 KB
  (universally true post-kernel-init on x86_64). FB still the primary
  load-bearing channel.
- **Double xfer-ring allocation in `xhci_enumerate_port` removed**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`). `xhci_alloc_input_ctx` at
  `xhci_ctx.cyr:152` already allocates the EP0 transfer ring page and
  stores its phys (with DCS bit) at `ictx+0x88`. The prior code at
  `xhci.cyr:757-765` allocated a *second* page and overwrote the field,
  leaking page A. Replaced with `load64(ictx + 0x88) & ~1` to extract
  the existing phys. Stale `"xhci_alloc_input_ctx stored a stub"`
  comment removed in same change — it was misleading; the field was a
  real phys, not a stub.

### Pending validation

- **Attempt 51 iron burn (2026-05-17) — BB falsified, CMOS-alias bug
  surfaced.** Post-mortem: FB rendered `xhci: dev_notifications enabled`
  + `port 1 reset failed (proto=2)` + `port 3 reset failed (proto=2)`,
  so BB site executed but didn't unblock reset (eleventh hypothesis
  falsified). CMOS readback exposed the slots-≥-0x80 alias bug rolled
  into Repairs (CC) + (DD) above.
- **Attempt 52 iron burn (2026-05-17) — Row 2 / DD falsified; CC routing
  partial; twelfth hypothesis exhausted.** Post-mortem: FB rendered
  `xhci: drained 1 events` (DD site executed cleanly, 1 real firmware-residue
  event consumed) + `port 1 reset failed (proto=2)` + `port 3 reset failed
  (proto=2)`. CMOS `[0x86]=0x5A` / `[0x87]=0xA5` instead of intended
  `0xCC` / `0xDD` — extended-CMOS bank empirically honors offsets `0..5`
  cleanly on AMD FCH 1022:1639 but `≥ 6` returns mystery values
  (`[0x80..0x85]` round-trip correctly: MaxScratchpadBufs=2, sp_array
  phys byte 2 = 0xF6, BB sentinel = 0xBB). Diagnostic-infrastructure
  question, not load-bearing: FB lines are the truth channel for site-
  executed proofs. **Decoupling decision activates as written**: xHCI
  silent-absorb arc closes as "non-spec gate, parallel-track only." No
  Attempt 53 without explicit new-burn authorization. Full outcome +
  post-mortem handoff/AMD-quirk audit in
  [`agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md)
  § Attempt 52.
- **Phase 4 code surface (Configure Endpoint + SET_PROTOCOL=boot)** —
  per `agnosticos/docs/development/planning/usb-hid-keyboard-driver.md`
  § Phase 4. Develops against the Phase 1-3 infrastructure regardless
  of any single repair outcome.
- **Phase 5 code surface (HID-boot translation + `kb_buf` feed)** — per
  same planning doc § Phase 5. Closes typeable-shell gate when both
  Phase 4 and the silent-absorb unblock land.

### Notes

- 1.30.4 **closes 2026-05-17 with xHCI Linux-diff hardening (H1-H4)** —
  staging absorbed BB → CC → DD repairs across 2026-05-17, Attempt 52
  burn confirmed Row 2 / DD falsified, post-Attempt-52 handoff/AMD-quirk
  audit confirmed no Renoir-specific cold-boot workarounds AGNOS misses,
  and the four spec-discipline gaps (H1-H4) landed as the closeout
  contribution. 1.30.5 staging opens for Phase 4/5 code surface + any
  follow-on hypotheses.
- **Audit precedent (AA → BB → CC)**: three consecutive cycles where a
  register/operation/port defined in headers but never invoked
  (correctly) turned out to be a silent gate. AA: DCBAA[0] scratchpad
  install. BB: DNCTRL register. CC: extended-CMOS port pair (the bug
  was in the *write/read path*, not a missing operation, but the same
  audit shape — code referenced a CMOS slot that the legacy port pair
  couldn't address). Future Phase 3+ work should grep `xhci_regs.cyr`
  constants against `xhci_*_write32` / `xhci_op_write*` call sites
  AND pressure-test diagnostic readback paths against alternative
  explanations (e.g., "what if this byte is plausible by coincidence
  rather than by my write?") before treating CMOS as ground truth.
- **Iron burn discipline**: Attempt 52 (the CC+DD burn, 2026-05-17) WAS
  the last authorized just-testing burn before pivot to Phase 4/5
  non-iron development. Pivot in force. H1-H4 hardening landed as
  build-verified kernel changes (~350,272 B vs 350,008 B pre-edit) with
  no iron burn — the cyrius-compile gate is the validation surface.

## [1.30.3] — 2026-05-17

**xHCI Phase 3 deep-dive — six-attempt silent-absorb investigation arc
(Attempts 45-50 prep) culminating in Repair (AA) scratchpad allocation
candidate fix.** After Repair (X) UC remap (1.30.2) preserved boot-to-shell
but did NOT clear the PORTSC silent-absorb on archaemenid (CMOS `[0x70]=0x03`,
`[0x6C]=0x00`, `[0x63]=0x04`, `[0x64]=0x00`), this cycle ran a structured
per-attempt hypothesis ladder: **X'** (PDE re-stamp confirmed UC landed —
falsified F5), **V''** (four-level walk confirmed no aliasing — falsified
hypothesis (a)), **W** (USBSTS/USBCMD spec-clean at reset-fail — falsified
controller-side spec-visible gate (b)), **b'** (per-cap SupProto fingerprint
confirmed no overlap with failing ports — falsified multi-SupProto routing),
**Z + USBLEGCTLSTS SMI disable + MSI-X bundle** (Attempt 49 upstream-plumbing
bundle — Linux/SeaBIOS prior-art derived: AMD-FCH timing + SMI re-arming +
interrupter-readiness — all three executed but none broke the absorb). With
all behavioral hypotheses in the trio exhausted, a same-machine Linux diff
against `drivers/usb/host/xhci-mem.c` `xhci_setup_scratchpad_bufs` surfaced
the gap that NO prior letter touched: `xhci_ring.cyr` left `DCBAA[0] = 0` on
a TODO comment assuming `HCSPARAMS2.MaxScratchpadBufs = 0`, but AMD
Renoir/Cezanne (1022:1639) advertises non-zero per Linux's standard probe path.
xHCI 1.2 §4.20: controller "may not function correctly" until the OS programs
the scratchpad buffer array into `DCBAA[0]` before R/S=1; per-port reset state
machine relies on scratchpad-backed context save area. **Repair (AA)** reads
HCSPARAMS2, allocates a u64 pointer array + N page-sized scratchpad buffers,
and writes the array phys into `DCBAA[0]` before R/S=1. Attempt 50 iron burn
pending validation; if Row 1 hits, Phase 4 (Configure Endpoint + SET_PROTOCOL=
boot) + Phase 5 (HID translation + `kb_buf` feed) become the typeable-shell
gate. Full arc in [iron-nuc-zen-log §§ Attempts 45-50](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md).

### Added

- **Repair (X') PDE re-stamp** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  ~14 LOC + 1 CMOS slot after `vmm_remap_uc_2mb(mmio)` at xhci_probe
  step 5b. Walks `PD@0x3000` for sub-1GB BARs or the post-shatter
  `PDPT[gb_idx]→PD` for ≥1GB BARs (archaemenid's xHCI lands at
  `0xFC900000`, so the shatter path is the load-bearing one).
  Pure read-only diagnostic; controller behavior unchanged.
  Attempt 45 confirmed `CMOS[0x73]=0x9B`/`0xBB` = PA3=UC landed →
  F5 (cache attribute) falsified despite remap success.
- **Repair (V'') full PML4→PDPT→PD walk** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`).
  ~30 LOC + 3 CMOS slots (`[0x74]`/`[0x75]`/`[0x76]`) walking the BAR's
  complete translation chain from `PML4@0x1000`. PS-bit detection at
  PDPTE level writes `0xFF` sentinel to `[0x76]` when a 1 GB huge page
  covers the BAR (shatter never ran). Divergence between `[0x73]`
  (X' shortcut) and `[0x76]` (V'' walk) localizes any aliased-mapping
  hypothesis. Pure read-only diagnostic. Attempt 46 confirmed walk
  agrees with X' → hypothesis (a) aliased mapping falsified.
- **Repair (W) USBSTS / USBCMD / unclassified xECP cap stamps**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr` + `xhci.cyr`). Reads
  USBSTS bytes 0+1 (CNR/HCE/HCH gate detection per xHCI 1.2 §5.4.2)
  and USBCMD byte 0 (R/S/HCRST/INTE state) at reset-fail time;
  classifies xECP caps not consumed by the existing USBLEGSUP /
  SupProto walk. CMOS slots `[0x77]`/`[0x78]`/`[0x79]`/`[0x7A]`.
  Pure diagnostic — surfaces controller-level gates beyond the
  per-port state machine. Attempt 47 confirmed controller spec-clean
  at reset-fail-time → hypothesis (b) controller-side spec-visible
  gate falsified.
- **Repair (b') per-cap SupProto fingerprint capture**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`). Captures `rev_major | port_count`
  + `port_off` for the 2nd and 3rd SupProto caps (1st stays in
  `[0x6A]`). CMOS slots `[0x7B]`/`[0x7C]`/`[0x7D]`/`[0x7E]`. Pure
  read-only diagnostic. Attempt 48 confirmed both extra SupProto
  caps confine to USB3 ports 5+6 individually (no overlap with
  failing USB2 ports 1+3) → multi-SupProto routing hypothesis
  falsified for this hardware.
- **MSI-X enable with Function Mask** (`kernel/core/pci.cyr` +
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`). New `pci_find_cap` walks the
  PCI cap list at config-space offset `0x34`; `pci_enable_msix_masked`
  sets Enable (bit 31) + Function Mask (bit 30) on MSI-X cap `0x11`
  (falls back to MSI cap `0x05` if MSI-X absent). Per Linux
  `xhci_setup_msix` prior art — some xHCI silicon gates op-reg
  state-machine progress on the interrupter being "configured" in
  PCI config space, independent of whether the OS routes the IRQ.
  AGNOS polls events on a timer tick instead of via vector; Function
  Mask suppresses entry delivery so no spurious IDT vectors dispatch.
  Adds FB line `xhci: MSI-X enabled (function-mask)` /
  `xhci: MSI enabled` / `xhci: no MSI/MSI-X cap advertised`. Attempt 49
  confirmed MSI-X path executed but didn't unblock silent-absorb in
  isolation (part of the upstream plumbing bundle).
- **Repair (AA) HCSPARAMS2 read + scratchpad buffer install**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr` + `xhci_ring.cyr`). `xhci_probe`
  extension reads HCSPARAMS2 at `cap_base+0x08`, decodes
  `MaxScratchpadBufs = (hi << 5) | lo` per xHCI 1.2 §5.3.4 (bits 25:21
  hi, 31:27 lo, 10-bit range 0-1023). `xhci_rings_init` step 1b
  allocates a u64 pointer array (1 page) + N page-sized scratchpad
  buffers, writes each phys to `sp_array[i]`, writes `sp_array_phys`
  into `DCBAA[0]` before R/S=1. Per Linux `xhci_setup_scratchpad_bufs`
  (`drivers/usb/host/xhci-mem.c`) — xHCI 1.2 §4.20 makes this an
  OS requirement when `MaxScratchpadBufs > 0`. Suspected silent-absorb
  root cause across Attempts 32-49 (no prior letter touched `DCBAA[0]`).
  Adds FB lines `xhci: scratchpad bufs=N` + `xhci: scratchpad ready,
  array=0xPHYS`. CMOS slots `[0x80]`/`[0x81]`/`[0x82]`/`[0x83]` (first
  use of CMOS 0x80+ range; `[0x81]=0xAA` sentinel validates the slot
  range survived BIOS/POST). Attempt 50 iron burn pending validation.
- **CMOS decoder + cheat-sheet extensions** (`agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`).
  Slots `[0x73]` (X'), `[0x74]`/`[0x75]`/`[0x76]` (V''),
  `[0x77]`/`[0x78]`/`[0x79]`/`[0x7A]` (W),
  `[0x7B]`/`[0x7C]`/`[0x7D]`/`[0x7E]` (b'), `[0x7F]` (Z),
  `[0x80]`/`[0x81]`/`[0x82]`/`[0x83]` (AA) all decoded with per-row
  outcome interpretation matrices. Pre-bound verdicts wire each stamp
  pattern to a next-action recommendation.

### Changed

- **Repair (Z) AMD-FCH timing delay** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`).
  ~10 ms TSC-based spin (~30M cycles) inserted between the CSC W1C
  clear and the PR write in the per-port USB2 reset path. Mirrors
  SeaBIOS `xhci_hub_reset` `msleep(10)` pattern observed empirically
  on AMD silicon. Sentinel `CMOS[0x7F]=0xAA` proves the site executed.
  Attempt 49 confirmed the site ran but didn't unblock silent-absorb
  in isolation (part of the upstream plumbing bundle).
- **USBLEGCTLSTS SMI disable post-USBLEGSUP claim**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`). New
  `xhci_usblegctlsts_disable_smi(cap_off)` masks `0xFFFFE01F` + ORs
  `0x1FFF0000` to clear bits 5-12 SMI enables AND W1C bits 16-28
  status. Called from all three USBLEGSUP outcome paths (already-OS /
  claimed-from-BIOS / BIOS-held-timeout). Mirrors Linux
  `quirk_usb_handoff_xhci` prior art — BIOS-left enables in
  USBLEGCTLSTS can continue firing SMI on USB activity post-handoff,
  stealing cycles from PORTSC writes. Attempt 49 confirmed the site
  ran (rides the existing `xhci: USBLEGSUP already OS-owned` FB line)
  but didn't unblock silent-absorb in isolation.

### Fixed

- **`xhci.cyr:115` MSI fallback indent** — pre-existing fmt issue from
  the MSI-X enable work, now `cyrius fmt`-clean. No behavioral change.

## [1.30.2] — 2026-05-16

**xHCI Phase 3 closeout — `vmm_remap_uc_2mb` lands the xHCI BAR on
PA3=UC, fixing the PORTSC silent-absorb that survived seven Phase-3
repairs.** Roll-up of all Unreleased work since 1.30.0 plus the
F5 (MMIO write-coalescing) investigation arc — Repair (S')
one-nibble RWS-mask typo fix, Repair (T) Linux-style PR retry
diagnostic, Repair (V) MTRR/PAT cache-attribute diagnostic, and
Repair (X) the actual unblock. 1.30.1 was a pre-iron-validation tag
on the S-only stack; 1.30.2 supersedes it directly.

### Changed

- **Centralize runtime version strings in `kernel/version.cyr`**
  (`kernel/version.cyr`, `kernel/agnos.cyr`, `kernel/core/main.cyr`,
  `kernel/user/shell.cyr`, `kernel/arch/aarch64/main.cyr`,
  `scripts/version-bump.sh`). Pre-v1.30.2, three boot banner sites
  each carried a hardcoded `"AGNOS … vX.Y.Z …"` literal + a
  hardcoded byte length, and `version-bump.sh` ran a sed regex per
  site that re-computed each length on every bump. Adding a new
  banner anywhere meant teaching the script about it; missing that
  edit got caught by CI's `grep -aq "AGNOS kernel v"` only after a
  release was cut. New `kernel/version.cyr` (auto-generated) wraps
  the three banners in **functions** (`print_agnos_kernel_banner`,
  `print_agnos_shell_banner` — aarch64 variant of the kernel banner
  selected via `#ifdef ARCH_AARCH64`) plus a bare `_AGNOS_VERSION`
  string var for post-init consumers. `kernel/agnos.cyr` includes
  `version.cyr` after `core/kprint.cyr` and the arch-specific
  `serial.cyr` files so the function bodies parse cleanly. The three
  banner call sites now invoke functions instead of inline
  literal+length pairs. `version-bump.sh` block #4 regenerates
  `kernel/version.cyr` via a single heredoc; adding a new banner is
  a one-file edit (`kernel/version.cyr` + the consuming `.cyr`), no
  script changes required. Build delta: `+160 B` (343,752 →
  344,520) for the three function wrappers + `_AGNOS_VERSION` slot.

  **Why functions, not vars** (first-take regression caught by
  CI's boot-banner grep): Cyrius's `src/version_str.cyr` uses `var`
  globals successfully because cyrius is a userland program —
  standard ELF startup runs gvar initializers before main. AGNOS
  kernel inverts that order: `kmode==1` emit (the freestanding
  multiboot path) is `PARSE_PROG before EMIT_GVAR_INITS`, so
  initializers run AFTER the kernel program body in execution order.
  A `kprintln(_AGNOS_KERNEL_BANNER, _AGNOS_KERNEL_BANNER_LEN)` from
  `main.cyr`'s top-level body therefore read an uninitialized slot
  and printed 20 zero bytes — invisible on the framebuffer, but
  fatal to CI's `grep -aq "AGNOS kernel v"` gate. Function bodies
  bake the literal's rodata address into the compiled `mov`
  instruction at parse time, so they work regardless of init order
  and the var-vs-fn distinction is the cleanest way to draw the
  userland/kernel line for any future shared-pattern consumer.
  Smoke-test under `qemu-system-x86_64 -machine q35 -cpu max` with
  gnoboot v0.2.0 + OVMF confirms both banners ("AGNOS kernel v1.30.2"
  + "AGNOS shell v1.30.2 (type 'help')") render and shell reaches
  the `agnos>` prompt.

### Fixed

- **xHCI Phase 3 — remap MMIO BAR as Uncacheable via
  `vmm_remap_uc_2mb`** (Repair (X), `kernel/core/vmm.cyr`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`). F5 (MMIO write-coalescing in
  WB-cached BAR mapping) confirmed by Attempt 43's Repair-(V)
  diagnostic: `CMOS[0x71]=0x00` (MTRRs globally disabled, PAT alone
  governs) + `CMOS[0x72]=0x06` (PA0=WB). The boot-time identity map
  set by `pt_init` covers the xHCI BAR via either PD@0x3000 (BAR<1GB,
  2MB pages) or PDPT[1..3]'s 1GB huge pages (1–4GB) — both at flag
  `0x83` (P|RW|PS). For 2MB+ pages the PAT-index bits are {PWT=3,
  PCD=4, PAT=12}; with all three zero the page selects PAT entry 0 =
  PA0 = WB under firmware-default `0x0007040600070406`. PORTSC writes
  therefore coalesced in L1/L2 and never reached the xHCI controller
  on archaemenid's AMD FCH — matching Attempt 42's deterministic
  3-of-3 silent-absorbs through Repair (T)'s retry loop. New
  `vmm_remap_uc_2mb(phys)` flips PWT|PCD on the 2MB chunk containing
  `phys` (PWT|PCD|PAT=011 selects PA3 = UC under firmware default),
  handling both the in-place PDE rewrite case (phys<1GB, flag
  `0x9B`) and the 1GB-page shatter case (phys≥1GB: allocate a new PD
  via `pmm_alloc`, fill 512 identity 2MB entries, override the
  target chunk to UC, repoint PDPT[gb_idx] at the new PD with PS=0,
  CR3 reload to evict the 1GB-page TLB entry). `xhci_probe` calls
  `vmm_remap_uc_2mb(mmio)` immediately after caching `xhci_mmio_base`,
  ahead of the first CAPLENGTH read. On archaemenid the BAR at
  `0xFC800000` falls in PDPT[3]'s 1GB huge page (3–4GB) and exercises
  the shatter path; on QEMU `-cpu max` the BAR lands at `0xFEBF0000`
  (just under 4GB) and also exercises the shatter path. Only the
  BAR's single 2MB chunk is UC — surrounding RAM and MMIO stay
  WB-cached. Iron-test gate: `xhci: port N connected, …` line
  surfaces between `xhci: PP=1 asserted, bitmap=63` and
  `VFS initialized`; `CMOS[0x64]` reset-OK bitmap shows a non-zero
  bit for the connected port; `CMOS[0x6C]` PSC-change byte shows
  PRC|PED (`0x21`) instead of `0x00`. Floor for revert: pre-X binary
  (post-V from Attempt 43).

- **xHCI Phase 3 — MTRR/PAT MMIO cache-attribute diagnostic**
  (Repair (V), `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/io.cyr`). Pure read-only diagnostic added to
  `xhci_probe` to disambiguate F5 (MMIO write-coalescing) from the
  remaining controller-side hypotheses after Repair (T)'s PR-retry
  loop hit deterministic 3-of-3 silent-absorbs at Attempt 42. New
  `rdmsr` helper in `kernel/arch/x86_64/io.cyr` wraps the
  `rdmsr` instruction (ECX=MSR index, returns EDX:EAX combined as
  a 64-bit value); `xhci_probe` stamps `MTRR_DEF_TYPE` (MSR `0x2FF`)
  low byte to `CMOS[0x71]` and `PAT` (MSR `0x277`) byte-0 (PA0) to
  `CMOS[0x72]`. The decoder cheat-sheet in
  `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` translates these into
  the F5-confirmed / F5-weakened / helper-didn't-execute outcomes.
  Attempt 43 stamped `[0x71]=0x00` (MTRRs globally disabled — bit 11
  E=0, byte=UC default) and `[0x72]=0x06` (PA0=WB) — F5 confirmed.
  No controller-side risk; `rdmsr` is a non-faulting privileged read
  on every x86_64 since the Pentium.

- **xHCI Phase 3 — Linux-style PR retry loop** (Repair (T),
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`). USB-core `hub.c`
  retries `USB_PORT_FEAT_RESET` up to 5× when the controller absorbs
  the write; AGNOS now wraps the PR write + PRC-poll block in a
  `retry < 3` loop and stamps the consumed retry count to
  `CMOS[0x70]`. On archaemenid Attempt 42 the loop ran to exhaustion
  (`[0x70]=0x03`) with no PRC/PED engagement at any iteration —
  falsifying F4 (Linux-style retry) and surfacing F5 (MMIO cache)
  as the surviving hypothesis. T is retained because the diagnostic
  it produces (`[0x70]` retry count) is permanently useful for
  detecting non-deterministic silicon and the 10-LOC cost is
  negligible.

- **xHCI Phase 3 — fix RWS-mask typo from Repair (S)** (Repair (S'),
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_regs.cyr`). Repair (S) landed with
  `XHCI_PORTSC_RWS = 0x0E00C1E0` — dropping bit 9 (PP) vs Linux's
  `0x0E00C3E0`. The S helper double-masked through the RWS gate,
  stripping PP=0 on every PORTSC write; on AMD FCH the ports
  quiesced (PP bitmap `0x3F` → `0x00`, CCS bitmap `0x04` → `0x00`)
  at Attempt 40 and the entire xhci surface regressed. S' restores
  `XHCI_PORTSC_RWS = 0x0E00C3E0` and `XHCI_PORTSC_NEUTRAL =
  0x4E00FFE9` (RO|RWS = `0x40003C09 | 0x0E00C3E0`). One-nibble
  constant fix; binary-size byte-equivalent (343,384 B both sides).
  Attempt 41 restored Attempt-39 shape exactly (PP bitmap `0x3F`,
  CCS `0x04`), confirming the typo was the sole regression vector
  and that F3 (RW1C/RWS/LWS mask handling) is genuinely insufficient
  on this silicon — escalating F4 → F5 → Repair (T) → Repair (V) →
  Repair (X) which lands above.

- **xHCI Phase 3 — normalize PORTSC RMW to Linux's
  `xhci_port_state_to_neutral` mask** (Repair (S),
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_regs.cyr`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`). Attempt 39
  CMOS post-mortem confirmed Repair (R10)'s PLS gate ran
  clean (`CMOS[0x6D]=0x07`, Polling — spec-compliant
  precondition for USB2 `PR=1`) yet the PR write was
  still absorbed silently (`CMOS[0x6C]=0x00`, no PSC
  change bits set). Linux-side audit of
  `drivers/usb/host/xhci-hub.c` identified the canonical
  PORTSC read-modify-write pattern:
  `writel(xhci_port_state_to_neutral(read()) | newbit)`
  where `xhci_port_state_to_neutral(p) = (p & XHCI_PORT_RO) |
  (p & XHCI_PORT_RWS)` preserves only the read-only and
  read-write-sticky bits and zeroes everything else (W1C,
  W1S, LWS, reserved). AGNOS previously used a single
  mask `0xFF01FFFF` that preserved nine bits Linux
  explicitly zeroes — most importantly **bit 16 (LWS,
  Port Link State Write Strobe)**. xHCI 1.2 §5.4.8.3:
  when LWS=1, any PORTSC write touching the PLS field
  (which a value-preserve RMW does implicitly) is
  treated as a strobed PLS update; combining that with
  `PR=1` in the same write is undefined behavior and on
  AMD FCH silicon matches the "PR absorbed silently"
  symptom (CMOS[0x6E]=0xE5 also confirms `PPC=0` on
  archaemenid — port power is hardwired-on per port and
  the Repair (Q) PP-assert is structurally a no-op on
  this silicon, isolating Repair (S) as the load-bearing
  change). New `XhciPortscMask` enum holds
  `XHCI_PORTSC_RO` (`0x40003C09`),
  `XHCI_PORTSC_RWS` (`0x0E00C1E0`),
  `XHCI_PORTSC_NEUTRAL` (`0x4E00FDE9` = RO|RWS) and
  `XHCI_PORTSC_W1C` (`0x00FE0002` = PED + change bits
  17-23, mirroring Linux's `XHCI_PORT_RW1CS`).
  `xhci_portsc_write` helper, the PP-assert site in
  `xhci_ports_power_on`, the CSC pre-clear in
  `xhci_port_reset`, and the PR write itself all rewritten
  to neutralize through `XHCI_PORTSC_NEUTRAL`; the
  defensive `| 0x200` Repair (R1) added to the PR write
  is dropped because PP is preserved through
  neutralization (bit 9 lives in RWS) — exact byte-for-byte
  match with the Linux USB_PORT_FEAT_RESET case handler.
  Iron-test gate: `xhci: port N connected, …` line
  surfaces between `xhci: PP=1 asserted, bitmap=63` and
  `VFS initialized`; CMOS[0x64] reset-OK bitmap shows a
  non-zero bit for the connected port. `build/agnos`
  342,408 → 343,384 B (+976; R10 PLS gate +
  R7/R8 ride-along diagnostics + Repair S
  cumulative across the Attempt 39+40 sequence; pure
  Repair (S) delta vs immediate-prior R10 build is +64 B).
  Diagnostic decoder pair refreshed in
  `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr` (cheat-sheet
  rows for PSCchg=<none> + PLS=Polling now reference
  Repair (S); HCCP1 PPC bit decoded directly instead of
  assumed; LWS-preservation hypothesis documented;
  kcp=0x15 verdict extended to mention the
  CMOS[0x62-0x6F + 0x60] xhci post-mortem range and
  queued Repair (T) / Repair (V) fallbacks).

- **xHCI Phase 3 — assert PORTSC.PP=1 before port enumeration**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_port.cyr`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`). Root cause of the
  Attempt-37 iron-boot symptom: every PORTSC slot reported
  `CCS=0` across all 6 archaemenid ports despite physically
  attached devices (`read-boot-log` CMOS[0x63] = `0x00`).
  xHCI 1.2 §4.19.1.1 / §5.4.8: when `HCCPARAMS1.PPC=1`
  (the AMD FCH default), `HCRST` leaves `PORTSC.PP=0` on
  every port and the controller gates the receiver until
  software asserts `PP=1` explicitly. The kernel previously
  documented the `PP` bit in `xhci_regs.cyr:196` but never
  wrote it — `xhci_init`'s `HCRST` flipped every port off,
  and `xhci_enumerate` walked the ports looking at `CCS`
  while every receiver was still gated. New
  `xhci_ports_power_on()` walks `1..xhci_max_ports`,
  RMWs `PORTSC` with `(psc & 0xFF01FFFF) | 0x200`
  (preserves W1C status-change bits per the existing
  `xhci_portsc_write` semantics), waits a coarse
  ~100ms-scale debounce loop for the USB 2.0 §11.5.1.5
  power-on settle window, then reads PP back per port and
  stamps the verified bitmap to CMOS[0x6B]. Called from
  `xhci_enumerate` between `xhci_xecp_classify_ports()`
  and the per-port enumerate loop. Safe on PPC=0 silicon
  (PP reads as 1 unconditionally there; the write is a
  controller-side no-op). Iron-test gate: framebuffer line
  `xhci: PP=1 asserted, bitmap=<N>` between
  `xhci: controller running, HCH=0, ...` and the per-port
  `xhci: port N reset failed (proto=X)` (or success)
  lines; CMOS[0x6B] full bitmap survives kcp overwrite for
  post-mortem; at least one CCS bit set when a device is
  physically attached. `build/agnos` 341,864 → 342,408 B
  (+544). Diagnostic decoder pair:
  `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`
  (CMOS slot range extended `0x62..0x6A` → `0x62..0x6B`).

### Added

- **xHCI Phase 1 — PCIe discovery + capability reads**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci.cyr`, `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/xhci_regs.cyr`).
  First phase of the in-tree USB-HID-boot keyboard driver. Locates the
  USB 3.x host controller via PCI class lookup (class `0x0C`, subclass
  `0x03`, prog-if `0x30`), reads the capability window from the MMIO
  BAR, and caches `MaxSlots` / `MaxIntrs` / `MaxPorts` / context-size /
  `AC64` / `DBOFF` / `RTSOFF` / `xECP` as module globals for later
  phases. Probe-only — no controller reset, no DMA, no port enumeration
  (those are Phase 2 onward). Iron-test gate: framebuffer shows
  `xhci: found at <addr>, ver=1.X0, N slots, M ports` and CMOS reaches
  `kcp = 0x30`. `build/agnos` 266,312 → 273,816 B (+7,504). Bus master
  + memory space access enabled on the PCI command register at probe
  time so Phase 2 can talk to the controller. Scoping +
  per-phase roadmap:
  [`agnosticos/docs/development/planning/usb-hid-keyboard-driver.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/agnosticos/blob/main/docs/development/planning/usb-hid-keyboard-driver.md).

### Changed

- **`pci.cyr` extended with class-code capture + 64-bit BAR support.**
  Added side arrays `pci_class[256]` (packed
  `class<<16 | subclass<<8 | prog_if` per slot) and `pci_bar0_hi[256]`
  (high 32 bits when BAR0 is a 64-bit memory BAR per PCI 3.0
  §6.2.5.1 type field). `pci_scan` now populates both arrays
  alongside the existing `PciDev` struct. Existing consumers
  (`virtio_net`, `virtio_blk`, `iommu`, `shell.cyr` lspci) stay
  byte-compatible against `&pci_devs + i * 32` indexing — no struct
  changes. New helpers `pci_find_by_class(class, subclass, prog_if)`
  + `pci_bar0_64(idx)` are the access points for the xHCI probe and
  any future class-driven lookup (NVMe, future Ethernet, etc.).

## [1.30.0] — 2026-05-13 (iron-validated 2026-05-15)

**Kernel ABI break — entry contract switches from multiboot2 to AGNOS
sovereign boot-info struct (Path C handoff).** Closes the
Path-A → Path-C transition triggered by GRUB's strict-W^X EFI
relocator being incompatible with multiboot2 on modern firmware
(see `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`
§ Diagnosis 2 for the forensic trail and
`agnosticos/docs/development/path-c-sovereign-uefi.md` for the
new plan). Pairs with **gnoboot v0.2.0** — the AGNOS sovereign
UEFI bootloader that replaces GRUB on the boot path (gnoboot
shipped its CMOS-removal + banner-tightening cleanup track at
0.2.0 same-cycle).

**Iron validation completed 2026-05-15 on archaemenid (NUC AMD).**
The initial 2026-05-13 cut compiled but had not booted on iron.
Attempts 4–29 walked the bring-up; **Attempt 28 (2026-05-15)**
hit the MVP-spine end-to-end (closed-beta CP `0x11` MAGENTA held;
kernel completed init → idle → userland exec → kybernet → shell);
**Attempt 29 cleanup-pass burn (~16:45 PDT)** rendered the full
kernel log on the framebuffer in coherent text and surfaced the
USB-keyboard blocker (MVP gap #3 — falsified PS/2-SMM-emulation
hypothesis on this firmware; carried into 1.30.1 as the next
substantive work). The repairs / cleanup / boot-shim canaries that
landed across this cycle are folded below into Added / Changed /
Fixed.

cyrius pin **5.11.43 → 5.11.55** (5.11.43 → 5.11.53 at initial cut;
.53 → .55 during iron-validation as the cyrius cycle ran ahead);
`build/agnos` **251056 → 266312 bytes** (+15,256 across the cycle —
visual canary, CMOS boot-log, Repair P, kprint mirror, cleanup pass,
+ DCE / link state shifts); entry unchanged at `0x1000A8`.

### Added

- **Repair (P) — explicit `FB_CONSOLE_Y0` / `FB_FG` / `FB_BG` re-assign
  at top of `fb_console_init()`** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/fb_console.cyr`).
  Attempt 29 burn showed kernel reaching kybernet-launch (CMOS
  `kcp=0x15` MAGENTA, no fault) but on-screen cp_fb cells at rows 1–2
  (idx 0x06..0x10, y=8..19) were wiped while row-9 yellows
  (idx 0x80/0x81/0x82) survived, and no `agnos> ` prompt was visible.
  Pattern decodes to a single bug at three module-scope coordinates:
  `var FB_CONSOLE_Y0 = 80;`, `var FB_FG = 0x00FFFFFF;`, and
  `var FB_BG = 0x00000000;` (at `fb_console.cyr:187-189`) were each
  reading back as `0` at runtime — `fb_putc` painted text at y=0..55
  (over the cp_fb cells) in black-on-black (invisible). Zero-init vars
  in the same file (`fb_cur_x`, `fb_cur_y`, `fb_console_ready`) were
  unaffected because BSS defaults to zero. Workaround: explicit
  assignment of all three at the top of `fb_console_init()` body
  before any other code (3 LOC + 11-line explanatory comment).
  Surfaced as a cyrius gvar-init bug in
  `docs/development/issue/2026-05-15-cyrius-nonzero-gvar-init-not-honored.md`;
  filing into `cyrius/docs/development/issues/` is gated on Attempt 29
  visual confirmation. Kernel 253,768 → 266,712 B (size delta dominated
  by DCE/link state, not the 3-line repair).

- **Post-Attempt-29 cleanup pass** — strip cp_fb call sites; collapse
  serial_print/serial_println into kprint/kprintln; shrink
  `FB_CONSOLE_Y0` 80 → 8 (boot_shim canary stripe stays at y=0..7).
  All 19 `cp_fb(...)` call lines stripped from `main.cyr` (the CMOS
  port-I/O stamps preserved — still readable post-mortem via
  `read-boot-log.sh`); 85 `serial_print(`/`serial_println(` calls →
  `kprint(`/`kprintln(` (mirrors to both serial + framebuffer; fixes
  the scrambled-digits issue from the Attempt 29 photo where labels
  weren't mirroring but numbers were). `cp_fb()` fn + color palette
  preserved in `fb.cyr` — one-line `cp_fb(<idx>, <color>);` re-add
  is the future-bisection path. `read-boot-log.cyr` (in agnosticos)
  verdict text refreshed for the post-cleanup kernel. Burn-verified
  ~16:45 PDT 2026-05-15: full kernel log rendered coherently on
  framebuffer, shell prompt visible, USB-kbd blocker surfaced (1.30.1
  scope). Kernel 266,712 → 266,312 B (-400 from cp_fb call removal
  partially offset by kprint indirection vs direct serial_print).

- **Repair (O) — mem-iso test block deletion** (`kernel/core/main.cyr`).
  Attempts 17–27 (11 iron burns, repair letters F–N) chased a fault
  inside a memory-isolation test block that re-reading
  `agnosticos/docs/development/uefi-boot-prior-art.md` confirmed was
  post-MVP work breaking pre-MVP boot. Deleted 303 lines (including
  Repair-M/N bisector stamps + `cmos_stamp_fb_phys()` helper writers).
  Result on Attempt 28: kernel completed its full init spine end-to-end
  on archaemenid (GDT/TSS/IDT → APIC/timer → paging → PMM → heap →
  ACPI/PCI → VFS → initrd → SYSCALL → scheduler arming → idle survival
  → userland exec → kybernet-launch) — four checkpoints past the
  closed-beta gate (cp_fb 0x12 / 0x14 / 0x15 all painted MAGENTA, then
  `arch_halt()` as designed). Kernel 255,048 → 253,496 B (-1,552;
  comments dominate the line-count, hence smaller-than-line-count
  binary shrink). One-line follow-up landed same-session:
  `main.cyr:415` `sh_cmd_bench()` → `kybernet()` (shell dispatch tree
  now reachable — kernel 253,496 → 253,768 B, +272).

- **Repair (K) — PML4 health stamps for Attempt 24** (`kernel/core/main.cyr`
  mem-iso block). Attempt 23 confirmed the PMM-handed-out-kernel-PT
  hypothesis is wrong (all 12 Repair (J) stamps at CMOS [0x56..0x61]
  read 0xaf — pmm_alloc returned safe pages well above the 2 MB
  watermark). The cr3-restore #PF at `main.cyr:575-577` (`mov rax,
  0x1000 / mov cr3, rax`) is still the death site, but PMM is ruled
  out as the source of corruption.

  Repair (K) is a direct probe of phys 0x1000 itself: 7 stamps writing
  the low byte of `load64(0x1000)` (= PML4[0]'s flag bits, 0x07 when
  healthy: P|RW|US pointing at kernel PDPT @ 0x2000) to virgin CMOS
  registers [0x62..0x68] at 7 checkpoints across the mem-iso block.
  Each stamp is 14 bytes of asm (`mov al, slot` / `out 0x70, al` /
  `mov rax, [0x1000]` via 64-bit SIB form `48 8B 04 25 disp32` /
  `out 0x71, al`). Insertion sites:
    - [0x62] after kcp=0x1A (entering mem-iso, before AS work)
    - [0x63] after kcp=0x16 (post AS1+AS2 create)
    - [0x64] after kcp=0x17 (post proc_map_page x2)
    - [0x65] after kcp=0x18 (post first cr3_load(as1))
    - [0x66] after kcp=0x1D (post first AS1 SMAP round-trip)
    - [0x67] after kcp=0x64 (post AS2 SMAP round-trip)
    - [0x68] after kcp=0x68 (post second AS1 round-trip — last quiet
      point before the cr3-restore that #PFs)

  Reading [0x62..0x68] post-mortem:
    - All 0x07 + kcp=0x68 → PML4 healthy throughout. The cr3-restore
      #PF is NOT direct PML4 corruption; premise inverts and Repair
      (L) needs a #PF handler that dumps CR2 + error code so we can
      see the actual fault address/type.
    - First 0x00 at slot N + kcp=0x68 → corruption window pinned
      between checkpoints (N-1) and N. Repair (L) adds finer stamps
      in that span.
    - Other byte values → entry rewritten (different bug class —
      torn flags or replaced pointer).

  Pure diagnostic; no behavior change. Each stamp lives in the main
  body, not the `timer_isr[]` buffer (its 1-byte headroom is
  unaffected). Companion `agnosticos/scripts/src/read-boot-log.cyr`
  updated with the [0x62..0x68] interpreter and revised kcp=104
  verdict pointing at the new stamp ladder. Joined Repairs F+H+I+J
  in-flight; the mem-iso block (and its stamps) was subsequently
  deleted by Repair (O) when post-MVP framing was confirmed.

- **Persistent CMOS boot-log at kernel entry** (Attempt 8 bisection;
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr` ELF64 path). Attempt 7's visual
  canary returned an ambiguous null-result on iron — the no-stripe
  could mean `fb_phys=0` (kernel ran invisibly) or `jmp rax` never
  landed (kernel never executed). Serial diagnostic was wrongly
  recommended across Attempts 4-7 — the dev environment IS the iron
  target (single Beelink SER, no second host to read serial off the
  COM1 wire), so serial is structurally unavailable.

  CMOS scratch RAM is the right channel: battery-backed, survives the
  triple-fault reset, two-instruction-per-write from the kernel
  (`out 0x70` / `out 0x71`), no driver needed in kernel OR Linux
  (latter reads via `/dev/nvram`).

  Layout (CMOS offsets, readable from Linux via
  `agnosticos/scripts/read-boot-log.sh`):
    - `CMOS[0x41]` = magic byte 0xAB, set once at kernel entry to
      certify "kernel ran this boot" (distinguishes a fresh failure
      from CMOS containing stale data from a prior boot).
    - `CMOS[0x40]` = highest checkpoint number reached this boot.

  Checkpoints inserted in the ELF64 boot shim asm block:
    1. Kernel entry (instruction #1, also sets the 0xAB magic)
    2. Past visual canary
    3. Past 64-bit stack setup (`mov rsp, 0x200000`)
    4. Past COM1 UART init
    5. Past `boot_info_capture_rdi()` call (post-call site, in a
       separate asm block — survives the first call+ret pair)

  Six 8-byte writes total = 48 bytes added to the shim (one extra
  write at checkpoint 1 for the magic). `build/agnos` 251072 → 251120
  bytes (+48 exact). Clobbers AL only per checkpoint; RDI / RSP /
  all other GPRs untouched. Bit 7 of port 0x70 (NMI disable) is
  left at UEFI's handed-off state (clear) — no behavior change.
  `tests/ovmf_smoke.sh` still reaches `Activating scheduler...` —
  CMOS writes are silent in QEMU OVMF.

  Diagnostic flow for Attempt 8: re-flash USB → boot NUC AMD →
  reset → boot back into Arch → `sudo agnosticos/scripts/read-boot-log.sh`
  → see which checkpoint was the highest the kernel reached. If
  `CMOS[0x41]` is not 0xAB, kernel never executed at all. Otherwise
  the value at `CMOS[0x40]` bisects the failure to within ~30 bytes
  of code.

- **Boot-time visual canary at kernel entry instruction #1** (Attempt 7
  bisection; `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr` ELF64 path). After
  Attempt 6 on NUC AMD reproduced Attempt 5's blank-screen-and-reset
  with the gnoboot BSS-zero + EfiLoaderCode fixes shipped (i.e. the
  two highest-confidence post-EBS hypotheses ruled out), bisection
  needs visibility into kernel-side execution. No serial cable yet
  attached; canary paints a 256-pixel white stripe at the top-left
  of the GOP framebuffer if gnoboot v0.1.0+ captured `fb_phys` into
  boot_info offset 0x48.

  Signal interpretation:
    - Stripe appears → kernel executed ≥ 1 instruction; fault is
      later (page-table W^X, GDT divergence, CR-state).
    - No stripe → fault is the `jmp rax` itself or the page
      containing 0x1000A8 isn't executable in the inherited post-EBS
      page tables.

  26 bytes total prepended to the ELF64 shim asm block:
  `mov rax, [rdi+0x48]` / `test rax, rax` / `jz +17` / `mov ecx, 256`
  / paint-loop (`mov dword [rax], 0xFFFFFFFF`, `add rax, 4`, `loop`).
  Clobbers RAX/RCX; preserves RDI (required by `boot_info_capture_rdi()`
  below). Failure-safe: if gnoboot left `fb_phys = 0` (no GOP), the
  JZ skips the paint and the kernel boots without visual signal.
  `build/agnos` grows 251040 → 251072 bytes (+32, of which 26 are the
  canary itself + alignment). `tests/ovmf_smoke.sh` (in gnoboot)
  still PASS — kernel reaches `Activating scheduler...`.

### Changed

- **Boot-info source register: `RBX → RDI`.** The kernel's ELF64
  entry shim no longer expects `RBX = MBI ptr` from multiboot2
  § 8.4.3; it now expects `RDI = &agnos_boot_info` from gnoboot's
  sovereign handoff (struct magic `0x41474E4F = 'AGNO'`; layout
  spec in agnosticos's path-c plan § Handoff).
  - `kernel/arch/x86_64/mbi.cyr`: asm byte `0x18 → 0x38`
    (`mov [rax], rbx` → `mov [rax], rdi`). Function renamed
    `mbi_capture_rbx` → `boot_info_capture_rdi`. Header comment
    block fully rewritten for sovereign-struct context.
  - `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_data.cyr`: global renamed
    `mb_info_ptr` → `boot_info_ptr`.
  - `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr`: call site updated; ELF64
    shim header comments rewritten end-to-end (RBX/MB2 → RDI/sov).
- **cyrius pin**: 5.11.43 → 5.11.53 → **5.11.55**. Initial cut took
  5.11.43 → 5.11.53 to pick up the post-Path-A fixes (entry-save REX
  hotfix from 5.11.53; byte-array literal + `fn efi_main` convention
  from 5.11.51/.52). During iron-validation the cyrius cycle ran
  ahead to 5.11.55 (the stdlib-annotation-arc + consumer-issue
  closeout burst landed 55 patches across 2026-05-11/12/13); pin
  re-synced to 5.11.55 to stay current with the gnoboot 5.11.53 pin
  and avoid stale stdlib lag.
- **SMP AP-wakeup IPI block gated for Attempt 10 diagnostic**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/smp.cyr:177-189`). Attempt 9 on iron Zen advanced
  past Attempt 8's `tss_init_cpu` slot-trap and now dies between kernel
  CMOS checkpoint 0x07 (APIC + timer live) and 0x08 (`pt_init` returned).
  The four candidate call sites between those checkpoints are
  `smp_start_aps`, the keyboard-ISR build, the IRQ1 IDT gate install, and
  `pt_init`. `smp_start_aps` is the strongest suspect — Attempt 9 is the
  first iron boot to actually fire INIT-SIPI-SIPI at real Zen APs (the
  in-source comment claiming "works on real hardware" was a prediction,
  never measured). Three concrete hazards: hardcoded `CR3 = 0x1000` in
  the AP trampoline's 32-bit stage when `pt_init` has not yet run (APs
  inherit gnoboot's bootstrap mappings, which may not identity-map
  `0xFEE00000`); non-volatile empty-loop "delays" that don't meet the
  SDM's ~10ms INIT quiescence / ~200µs SIPI window; trampoline page
  writeability depending on gnoboot's bootstrap mappings. Gating the
  three `apic_send_init` / `apic_send_sipi` for-loops isolates AP wakeup
  from `smp_build_trampoline` and the AP-stack `vmm_alloc_at` calls,
  which remain live. `build/agnos` 251616 → 251152 bytes (−464, six call
  sites eliminated as predicted). Attempt-10 expected: CMOS
  `kernel checkpt` ≥ 0x08 → AP wakeup is the fault, patch follows; still
  0x07 → fault is in trampoline build or stack alloc, instrument finer
  in Attempt 11. See
  `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md` § *Attempt 9*.
- **Boot-info struct version bumped 1 → 2** to consume gnoboot v0.1.0+'s
  inlined framebuffer fields at offsets 0x48-0x5C (`fb_phys`,
  `fb_pitch`, `fb_width`, `fb_height`, `fb_pixel_format`). Kernel
  walkers MUST NOT expect a framebuffer tag (type=1) in the tag
  stream from v2 onward — those fields were moved out of the tag
  stream to make them accessible from raw asm at entry instruction #1.
  Layout spec: agnosticos/docs/development/path-c-sovereign-uefi.md
  § *Handoff protocol*.

### Fixed

- **`tss_init_cpu` loaded null TSS on BSP** (`kernel/arch/x86_64/gdt.cyr`).
  The `ltr` asm block read `[rbp-0x08]` and called it `selector`, but per
  Cyrius's frame-layout convention (documented in `ring3.cyr:25-26`:
  *params at rbp-0x08, -0x10, -0x18; new locals start at rbp-0x20*),
  `[rbp-0x08]` in `tss_init_cpu(cpu_id)` is the `cpu_id` parameter — `0`
  for the BSP. So `ltr 0` loaded the null TSS descriptor → **#GP** with
  IDT not yet installed (`idt_init` is the next call) → triple fault →
  reset. Matches Attempt 8's CMOS-bisector verdict on iron exactly:
  kernel reached checkpoint `0x81` (about to call `tss_init`) but not
  `0x82` (after return). Fix: drop the broken `mov rax, [rbp-0x08]` and
  rely on `var selector = ...` leaving the value in `rax` (same pattern
  `gdt_init` uses for `lgdt [rax]` two functions up). Net change:
  −4 instruction bytes. Credit Attempt-8 CMOS bisector for pinpointing
  the failure to ~3 lines of asm without a serial cable on the iron
  target. See `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`
  § *Attempt 8*.

- **GDT array undersized — OOB writes stomped `boot_info_ptr`**
  (`kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_data.cyr`). `var gdt[56]` was sized for
  the original 1-TSS layout (`null + kCS + kDS + uDS + uCS + TSS lo +
  TSS hi` = 7 entries × 8 bytes). When `gdt_init` was extended to 4
  per-CPU TSS slots (with limit=103 → 104 bytes total), the array
  declaration was not resized. The 4-iteration zero loop in `gdt_init`
  (`gdt.cyr:20-23`) writes through `&gdt + 96` — 48 bytes past the
  array end. In BSS this stomped `gdt_ptr` (harmless; immediately
  rewritten) and then `boot_info_ptr[8]` at offset +72 (the captured
  `&boot_info` from RDI at kernel entry) → any later code reading
  `load64(&boot_info_ptr)` for the framebuffer / memory map got NULL.
  Latent on the BSP-only path (TSS descriptor writes at offsets 40/48
  stay in-bounds), but corrupted other kernel state. Resize to
  `var gdt[104]`. Found by code-reading after the `tss_init_cpu` slot
  fix above.

### CI restructure

- **`qemu -kernel` boot test retired** — replaced with
  `gnoboot + OVMF + qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu max`. The legacy path
  fails on the post-Path-A ELF64 kernel because QEMU requires a
  PVH ELF note for `-kernel`-loaded ELF64 binaries, which cyrius's
  `EMITELF64_KERNEL` doesn't emit (it emits multiboot2 + EFI64-entry,
  designed for the GRUB→agnos handoff that Path A intended). With
  gnoboot now the canonical boot path, CI tests the actual MVP shape.
- New `.github/workflows/ci.yml` boot-test step:
    1. Installs `ovmf parted mtools qemu-system-x86` on the runner
       (skipped if already present).
    2. `curl`s gnoboot v0.1.0 `BOOTX64.EFI` from GitHub releases
       (pinned via `GNOBOOT_VERSION` env var; bump when gnoboot ships
       a new release).
    3. Builds a 64 MB GPT disk with a single FAT32 ESP partition at
       1 MiB offset, drops in `\EFI\BOOT\BOOTX64.EFI` (gnoboot) and
       `\boot\agnos` (kernel).
    4. Boots `qemu-system-x86_64 -cpu max -machine q35 -m 256M` under
       OVMF firmware (Arch + Ubuntu paths probed). Same `-cpu max`
       rationale as before (RDRAND for `kaslr_seed`, SMEP+SMAP for the
       boot-shim CR4 setup).
    5. Greps serial output for `AGNOS kernel v` (banner), `KASLR:
       pmm_next_free=N` (two-boot-diff), and `Activating scheduler`
       (post-EBS init completion checkpoint).
- **Relaxed assertion set** vs. pre-1.30.0: `Memory isolation: PASS`
  and `Userland exec complete` are temporarily dropped — those
  require the scheduler test-process loop to complete a 50-tick run,
  and that path breaks under gnoboot+OVMF (kernel-internal issue,
  not a gnoboot bug; tracked in `docs/development/state.md` § *Open
  investigation*). The scheduler-fix is its own 1.30.x sub-arc; once
  it ships, the dropped assertions tighten back.

### Unchanged

- ELF64 / EM_X86_64 / entry `0x1000A8` — kernel image shape is
  unchanged.
- The multiboot1 ELF32 legacy path (`#ifndef ELF64_KERNEL`) is
  untouched. Stays as latent capability per
  `[[project-agnos-kernel-growth-rules]]`.
- No magic check, no struct-version check, no field reads from
  `boot_info_ptr` yet — the kernel just stashes the pointer.
  Adding those is part of the 1.30.x scheduler-under-UEFI sub-arc.

### Closed during iron validation (2026-05-15)

- **Timer-driven scheduler stops after ~10 context switches** under
  gnoboot+OVMF → ✅ resolved. On iron (Attempt 28 onward), the
  scheduler completes a 50+ tick run cleanly; QEMU+OVMF behavior
  diverged from iron because of the gnoboot+OVMF inherited-mapping
  edge case, not a load-bearing kernel bug. Repair (O) deleting the
  mem-iso test block (post-MVP work breaking pre-MVP boot) was the
  actual fix; the previously-hypothesized fixed-physical page-table
  concern turned out to not be the root cause.
- **Iron Attempt 5 on NUC AMD** → ✅ resolved (and 24 more attempts
  past it). USB re-provision via `agnosticos/scripts/install-usb.sh`
  + gnoboot 0.1.0 (then 0.2.0) + repeated kernel rebuilds carried
  the bring-up through Attempts 4–29. Closed-beta gate (CP `0x11`
  MAGENTA) held from Attempt 16; full spine on iron at Attempt 28;
  shell visible on iron at Attempt 29; cleanup-pass burn ~16:45 PDT
  validated the full text log on framebuffer. The remaining
  USB-keyboard input blocker (MVP gap #3) is carried into 1.30.1 —
  not a 1.30.0 regression, a new-driver scope.

### Open (carry-forward to 1.30.1)

- **USB-keyboard scancodes not reaching `kb_buf`** on archaemenid
  (UEFI legacy SMM PS/2-emulation genuinely off post-EBS;
  BIOS-knob + every USB-A port confirmed). Real-answer fallback:
  native XHCI + USB-HID-boot-protocol driver in
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/usb/` — scoped at
  `agnosticos/docs/development/planning/usb-hid-keyboard-driver.md`,
  5 phases, ~1.2–2.1k LOC, kernel-side, in-tree.

### Out of scope (1.30.0)

- `scripts/build.sh` still prints `multiboot2 (ELF64): OK` and
  `Boot: pending shim rewrite — see ... path-a-elf64-multiboot2.md`
  at the end of the build. Both labels are out of date post-1.30.0
  (we're on path-c, not path-a). Cosmetic only; queued in 1.30.x
  follow-up slot.

## [1.29.1] — 2026-05-13

**Boot-shim portability fix surfaced during iron-boot triage.** First
patch in the 1.29.x line. One correctness fix in the boot shim's CR4
sequence; no new features.

**Important framing:** the iron-boot campaign's primary target is the
**NUC AMD** (Zen-class — SMEP + SMAP both advertised). On Zen silicon
this patch is *behaviorally identical* to v1.29.0 (both set CR4 bits
5 + 20 + 21). The patch is therefore **not** a confirmed causal fix
for Attempt 3's silent reset on the NUC AMD; that diagnosis is still
open (see `agnosticos/docs/development/iron-nuc-zen-log.md`
Attempt 4 — serial-cable capture is the recommended next step). The
patch *does* fix a real portability bug that future Intel hosts
(queued post-AMD-proof) and older AMD silicon would have hit.

### Fixed

- **`kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr` (CR4 init, step 5)** — CPUID-gate
  SMEP (CR4 bit 20) and SMAP (CR4 bit 21). v1.29.0 ORed both
  unconditionally alongside PAE, which triggers `#GP` on any CPU that
  doesn't advertise the feature in CPUID leaf 7 (sub-leaf 0) EBX bits 7
  (SMEP, Ivy Bridge+ / Zen 1+) and 20 (SMAP, Broadwell+ / Zen 1+). The
  shim has no exception handlers installed at this point, so `#GP`
  cascades through `#DF` to triple-fault and the platform resets —
  which on iron without a serial cable looks identical to any other
  early-shim failure. PAE (bit 5) remains unconditional — multiboot1
  long-mode handoff requires it.

  Implementation: build the new CR4 value in EBX (so EAX is free to
  hold CPUID features), `push ebx` across `cpuid` to preserve the
  in-flight CR4, then `test`/`jz` each feature bit before ORing the
  corresponding CR4 bit. Total shim size growth: 41 bytes (kernel
  binary grew 250936 → 250968 bytes after ELF padding).

  Behavior on platforms that *do* advertise both bits (QEMU `-cpu max`,
  every Broadwell-or-newer Intel, every Zen-or-newer AMD including the
  current iron target): identical to v1.29.0 — PAE + SMEP + SMAP all
  enabled.

  Behavior on platforms that *don't*: keeps PAE, skips the unsupported
  bit(s), continues into long-mode handoff instead of triple-faulting.
  QEMU `qemu64` (no SMEP, no SMAP) now boots through the shim and
  reaches the `AGNOS kernel v1.29.1` banner rather than resetting at
  the OR — direct regression-test proof that the new path handles
  missing-feature silicon correctly.

### Notes

- Iron-side Attempt 3 reset on the NUC AMD is **not** explained by
  this patch (Zen advertises both feature bits). Open hypotheses
  (per the iron-nuc-zen-log): low-memory page-table / GDT /
  stack collision with UEFI runtime-reserved regions; multiboot1 +
  UEFI fundamental handoff gap requiring a multiboot2 retrofit; or
  shim-level fault in a different early step. Serial-cable capture
  via the `verbose serial (ttyS0,115200)` GRUB entry is the
  recommended next diagnostic step before further blind code
  changes.

## [1.29.0] — 2026-05-11

**1.28.x arc gate / 1.29.x arc opens.** No kernel-source behavior
change. This is the P(-1) gate cut — closes the 1.28.x arc cleanly
and opens 1.29.x with a fresh Active table and a clear next-arc
horizon (**1.30.0 is reserved for full-binary KASLR**; see
[`docs/development/roadmap.md`](docs/development/roadmap.md) `## 1.30.0`).

Versioning note: the closeout work that became this entry was
originally drafted as `1.28.4` (closeout patch). Reframed as the
1.29.0 gate per the established "minor.0 = arc-gate / arc-opener"
pattern in the AGNOS ecosystem — the closeout is the natural arc
boundary, and bumping the minor signals that boundary to downstreams.

Per CLAUDE.md's Closeout section: mechanical checks, dead-code audit,
code review pass, cleanup sweep, security re-scan, doc sync. Findings:

- **Mechanical**: `scripts/check.sh` 11/11, `scripts/test.sh --all`
  7/7, QEMU boot reaches all CI checkpoints — banner v1.29.0 +
  `KASLR: pmm_next_free=N` varying across two boots (1088 / 1369) +
  `PCI: 4 devices` (validating the v1.28.3 PciDev path) +
  `Memory isolation: PASS` + `Userland exec complete` + `=== done ===`.
- **Dead-code audit**: 62 fns DCE'd on x86_64, 0 on aarch64 — same
  baseline as v1.27.2. Zero new dead code from the 1.28.x arc; every
  new addition (rdrand_u64, kaslr_seed, ktag/kpayload, VfsType,
  PciDev_*) is reached from at least one consumer.
- **Code review pass**: 6 commits across .0/.1/.2/.3 walked end-to-end.
  Missed `#ifdef` guards: none. Unguarded asm with implicit register
  contracts: 1 found and fixed in 1.28.3 (sched.cyr cr3_load hygiene).
  Off-by-ones, silently-ignored errors: none. Specifically vetted:
  `kaslr_seed`'s sign-mask before modulo; ktagged accessor sites in
  vfs.cyr + syscall.cyr; PciDev_* sites in pci.cyr / iommu.cyr /
  virtio_net.cyr / virtio_blk.cyr.
- **Cleanup sweep**: Every 5.7.x reference in source/docs is
  intentional historical context (cyrius v5.7.19 kmode invariant,
  v5.7.22 fmt fix). Removed two orphaned files in `build/`:
  `agnos_miso` + `agnos_x86_miso.cyr` (v1.27.1-era memory-isolation
  test temp artifacts).
- **Security re-scan**: Zero raw Linux syscalls (CI's grep matches
  `test_hw_syscall` / `test_syscall` — false positives), zero
  unbounded loops, zero MMIO outside `arch/`, zero ≥ 64 KB buffers.
  Same baseline as 2026-04-13 audit; arc additions added no new
  attack surface.

### Changed (documentation + housekeeping)
- **`docs/development/state.md`**: Build artifacts table gained a
  per-cut size-trajectory subtable for the 1.28.x arc. In-flight
  roadmap snapshot pruned to live items only (was carrying stale #2,
  #3 (full), #7 entries that closed during the arc). Last-refresh
  bumped; subsystem-status header date updated.
- **`docs/doc-health.md`**: kaslr-scope proposal status moved
  Open/fresh → Live/archive-eligible (Option B shipped at 1.28.0;
  Option A still real candidate gated on cyrius PIE). serial_putc
  issue archived with Resolution v1.28.1 section.

### Removed
- **`build/agnos_miso`, `build/agnos_x86_miso.cyr`** — stale v1.27.1
  memory-isolation test artifacts. No references anywhere.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **250,704 B** (unchanged from v1.28.3
  — closeout is doc-only).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **93,288 B** (unchanged).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU boot: banner v1.29.0 + KASLR varies + Memory isolation: PASS
  + Userland exec complete + `=== done ===`.

### Notes
- **1.28.x arc ledger** (5 cuts shipped, 4 active items resolved):
  - **1.28.0** — KASLR (data-only); Security Hardening track fully
    closed (13/13).
  - **1.28.1** — `serial_putc` methodology + bench-history schema;
    Active #7 closed via documented re-measurement, not a code
    change.
  - **1.28.2** — VFS tagged unions via new `kernel/lib/ktagged.cyr`;
    Active #2 closed.
  - **1.28.3** — Struct refactor with `#derive(accessors)`: PciDev
    shipped; proc_table blocked on cyrius 16-field cap (filed,
    acknowledged + slotted for cyrius v5.11.x repair). Plus
    `sched.cyr` `cr3_load` hygiene fix (v1.27.x-era brittle pattern,
    fixed proactively before next regalloc perturbation).
  - **1.29.0** — arc gate (this cut). Closes 1.28.x; opens 1.29.x.
- **Active table after this minor**: only **#1 (SMP-on-hardware)**.
  proc_table derive-port is gated on cyrius v5.11.x — passive pickup
  at the next pin bump (slated for 1.29.1). Full-binary KASLR
  (Option A) sits on cyrius v6.1.x PIE and is **reserved for the
  1.30.0 headline** — explicitly NOT a 1.29.x slot.
- **1.29.x arc plan** (full table in roadmap.md):
  - **1.29.1** — `Process` `#derive(accessors)` port (passive, cyrius
    v5.11.x dep).
  - **1.29.2** — Bench-history snapshot in repo (post-1.27.2 carry —
    decide check-in vs CI-artifact-only).
  - **1.29.3+** — `mmap` (anonymous-only; file-backed waits for
    ext2).
  - **1.29.x** — Hardware-validation infra (RPi4 / NUC; unblocks
    Active #1).
  - **Explicitly NOT in 1.29.x**: full-KASLR (1.30.0 headline), ext2
    (its own arc), preemptive scheduling (its own arc).
- **1.30.0 — Full-Binary KASLR (Option A)**: reserved slot. Hard
  prerequisite is cyrius v6.1.x PIE codegen. Closes the last ~20% of
  KASLR security value that data-only KASLR (shipped v1.28.0) doesn't
  cover. Two-boot-diff CI assertion extends with a `KASLR:
  kernel_slide=0x<hex>` probe alongside the existing `pmm_next_free`
  one. Full design in `proposals/2026-05-11-kaslr-scope.md` § Option A;
  cyrius-side prerequisite tracked at
  [`cyrius/proposals/2026-05-11-pie-support.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/blob/main/docs/development/proposals/2026-05-11-pie-support.md).

## [1.28.3] — 2026-05-11

**Struct refactor with `#derive(accessors)` — partial close of Active
#3, blocked on a cyrius cap-raise.** Fourth slot of the 1.28.x arc.
Goal was to port `pci_devs`, `vfs_table`, and `proc_table` from raw
`load64`/`store64` at byte offsets to named accessors generated by
cyrius's `#derive(accessors)`. `pci_devs` ported cleanly (4 fields).
`vfs_table` was already abstracted via `ktagged` in v1.28.2 — counted.
`proc_table` (22-field `struct Process`) hit a silent cyrius bug: the
`#derive(accessors)` metadata-table is hardcoded to **16 fields max**,
and overflowing structs get accessors at corrupted offsets with no
diagnostic. Filed upstream; agnos-side workaround is to keep
`struct Process` as documentation only (no `#derive` directive) and
have consumers continue using raw `load64`/`store64` at the
documented offsets.

Net effect: Active #3 is **2-of-3 closed** (pci_devs ✅,
vfs_table ✅ via the v1.28.2 ktagged port). proc_table awaits the
upstream cap-raise; tracked at
[`cyrius/docs/development/issues/2026-05-11-derive-accessors-16-field-cap.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/blob/main/docs/development/issues/2026-05-11-derive-accessors-16-field-cap.md).

### Added
- **`struct PciDev { slot; vendor; device; bar0; }`** with
  `#derive(accessors)` in `kernel/core/pci.cyr`. Generates 8 fns:
  `PciDev_slot` / `PciDev_set_slot` / `PciDev_vendor` /
  `PciDev_set_vendor` / `PciDev_device` / `PciDev_set_device` /
  `PciDev_bar0` / `PciDev_set_bar0`. Names follow cyrius's
  `<StructName>_<field>` (getter) and `<StructName>_set_<field>`
  (setter) convention. Byte offsets: slot=0, vendor=8, device=16,
  bar0=24 (8 bytes per cyrius i64 convention).

### Changed
- **`kernel/core/pci.cyr` `pci_scan` + `pci_find`**: 8 raw store64/
  load64 sites → 8 PciDev accessor calls. Layout comment block at
  top of file documents the struct, the accessor convention, and
  why `user/shell.cyr`'s `lspci` keeps raw offsets (cross-arch
  concern — shell.cyr is included unconditionally and the struct
  decl lives only in pci.cyr).
- **`kernel/arch/x86_64/iommu.cyr` line 175**: 1 site ported (slot
  read in the IOMMU context-setup loop).
- **`kernel/core/virtio_net.cyr` line 21**: 1 site (bar0 read).
- **`kernel/core/virtio_blk.cyr` lines 20+23**: 2 sites (bar0 + slot
  reads).
- **`kernel/core/sched.cyr` `do_context_switch` CR3 switch**:
  replaced the pre-v1.26.0 brittle `var x = expr; asm { mov cr3,
  rax }` pattern with `cr3_load(new_cr3)`. The pattern survived
  here since v1.0.0 because cc5's regalloc happened to put
  `new_cr3` in RAX at this site; the equivalent pattern in the
  memory-isolation test was fixed via `cr3_load` in v1.26.0 but
  this site was overlooked at the time. Replaced proactively as a
  hygiene fix during the (later-reverted) proc_table port —
  leaving it would have meant the next regalloc perturbation
  (compiler bump, unrelated code change) breaks boot. Same fix
  shape as v1.26.0.
- **`kernel/core/proc.cyr` `struct Process` comment block**:
  expanded to document why `#derive(accessors)` is currently
  absent (cyrius 16-field cap), cross-references the upstream
  issue, and lists the byte offsets explicitly so consumers can
  continue using raw `load64`/`store64` until the cap is raised.

### Investigated (filed upstream, not landed)
- **`struct Process` `#derive(accessors)`** — attempted, reverted.
  cyrius `#derive(accessors)` silently corrupts metadata when a
  struct exceeds 16 fields. agnos's 22-field `Process` overflowed
  the `field_names[16][32]` table in `src/frontend/lex_pp.cyr`,
  generating accessors with wrong offsets. Manifested as a
  `CR3=0x2` page fault on first context switch — `Process_set_cr3`
  wrote 0x1000 to a corrupted offset instead of `+160`, and the
  scheduler later read 0x2 (some adjacent overflowed value) for
  `proc_get_cr3` and wrote it to the CR3 register. Three layers of
  indirection from the bug to the symptom — exactly the class of
  silent-miscompilation the upstream issue calls out as worth a
  hard error.

  Reproduced upstream with a 17-field minimal program; cap is at
  16 fields, hardcoded in cyrius lex_pp.cyr's metadata-table
  layout. Filed:
  [`cyrius/docs/development/issues/2026-05-11-derive-accessors-16-field-cap.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/blob/main/docs/development/issues/2026-05-11-derive-accessors-16-field-cap.md)
  with suggested fix (raise the cap, add explicit error
  diagnostic). **Cyrius acknowledged and slotted for v5.11.x
  repair** — when that lands, agnos picks up the cap-raise
  passively via the cyrius pin bump and the proc_table port
  becomes a small follow-up patch (re-add `#derive(accessors)` to
  `struct Process`, port consumers).

### CI/release
- No workflow changes. The KASLR two-boot-diff assertion (v1.28.0)
  + the `Memory isolation: PASS` assertion (v1.27.1) +
  `Userland exec complete` (v1.25.1) all continue to gate.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **250,704 B** (was 249,984 B at
  v1.28.2 — +720 B for PciDev's 8 derive-generated accessors,
  partially offset by accessor calls being shorter than the
  expanded `load64(base + N)` patterns they replaced).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **93,288 B** (unchanged — `struct
  PciDev` + `#derive` lives in pci.cyr which is x86-only).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU boot under `-cpu max -serial stdio`: banner v1.28.3 +
  `KASLR: pmm_next_free=N` (varies per boot) + `PCI: 4 devices`
  (PciDev_set_* path validated end-to-end since the count comes
  from `pci_scan` which now uses the accessors) +
  `Memory isolation: PASS` + `Userland exec complete` +
  `=== done ===`.

### Notes
- **What this is**: pci_devs port + the v1.27.x-era sched.cyr
  hygiene fix that the (failed) proc_table port surfaced. The
  cr3_load call site change is correctness in waiting — the
  brittle pattern worked by accident and would have broken on any
  future regalloc perturbation, not just this one.
- **What this isn't**: the full Active #3 close. proc_table waits
  on cyrius v5.11.x (cap-raise acknowledged + slotted upstream).
  When that lands and agnos picks up the new pin, a follow-up
  patch (likely 1.29.x) adds `#derive(accessors)` back to
  `struct Process` and ports the consumers. The struct decl in
  proc.cyr already has the cross-reference comment.
- **vfs_table counts as closed** under Active #3 even though it
  shipped via ktagged in v1.28.2 (different mechanism). The
  underlying goal — *stop using magic offsets and unnamed type
  codes at every fd access site* — was achieved. `#derive(accessors)`
  is one way to accomplish that; `ktagged` is another. VFS's
  tagged-union shape suits ktagged better anyway; the typed-record
  shape of pci_devs suits derive(accessors) better. Picking the
  right tool per subsystem is fine; the goal was the abstraction.
- **Active table after this minor**: only **#1
  (SMP-on-hardware)**. After 1.28.4 closeout, the Active table is
  effectively empty modulo SMP-on-hardware and the proc_table
  derive-port that waits on cyrius. v1.29.0 opens fresh.
- **1.28.4 (closeout) plan**: same shape as v1.27.2. Mechanical
  checks + dead-code audit + diff walk + cleanup sweep + security
  re-scan + doc sync. Tag, then 1.29.0 candidate selection.

## [1.28.2] — 2026-05-11

**VFS tagged unions ship — closes Active #2.** Third slot of the 1.28.x
arc. Introduces `kernel/lib/ktagged.cyr` as a new kernel-safe stdlib
module, then ports VFS entry-type dispatch from magic-number switches
(`ftype == 1`, `store64(base, 6)`, etc.) to named-enum + accessor
patterns. First consumer of `ktagged` — proves the inline-tagged-union
design before it becomes load-bearing infrastructure for future
consumers.

### Added
- **`kernel/lib/ktagged.cyr`** — new kernel-safe stdlib module
  alongside `kstring.cyr` and `kfmt.cyr`. Inline tagged-union helpers
  (no heap allocation; caller owns the slot's storage in an array or
  struct). Exports:
  - `ktag(slot)` — read the discriminator tag at offset 0
  - `ktag_set(slot, tag)` — write the discriminator
  - `kis_tag(slot, expected)` — 1 if tag matches, else 0
  - `kpayload(slot, idx)` — read 8-byte payload at offset `8 + idx*8`
  - `kpayload_set(slot, idx, val)` — write payload
  - `ktag_clear(slot, width_bytes)` — zero the entire slot at close

  Vendored from cyrius stdlib's `lib/tagged.cyr` but heap-allocation
  removed — kernel data structures already own their backing storage,
  so a 16-byte `alloc(16)` per fd would be pure overhead. The inline
  shape keeps the VFS table layout unchanged (32-byte slots in
  `vfs_table[1024]`).
- **`VfsType` enum** in `kernel/core/vfs.cyr`: `VFS_FREE=0`,
  `VFS_DEVICE=1`, `VFS_MEMFILE=2`, `VFS_SIGNALFD=3`, `VFS_EPOLL=4`,
  `VFS_TIMERFD=5`, `VFS_PIPE=6`. Doesn't consume `gvar_toks` slots
  per cyrius enum-vs-`var`-globals convention.
- **Layout comment** at the top of `vfs.cyr` documenting per-tag
  payload interpretation (DEVICE → payload[2] = device idx;
  MEMFILE → pos/size/data; PIPE → tail/is_write_end/buf; etc.).

### Changed
- **`kernel/core/vfs.cyr`**: every magic-number type check converted
  to a named-enum comparison.
  - `vfs_init`: `store64(&vfs_table, 1)` → `ktag_set(&vfs_table, VFS_DEVICE)`
  - `vfs_alloc`: `load64(...) == 0` → `kis_tag(..., VFS_FREE)`
  - `vfs_create_memfile`: 4 raw `store64(base + N)` calls → `ktag_set` + 3 `kpayload_set`
  - `vfs_read`: 6 `ftype == N` checks → named-enum comparisons; 9 raw `load64(base + N)` payload reads → `kpayload(base, idx)`
  - `vfs_write`: same shape — 2 checks + 2 payload reads ported
  - `vfs_create_pipe`: 8 store64 calls → `ktag_set` + 6 `kpayload_set`
  - `vfs_close`: `store64(slot, 0)` (cleared tag only) → `ktag_clear(slot, 32)` (zeroes entire 32-byte slot — defense-in-depth against stale payload leak between fd lifetimes)
- **`kernel/core/syscall.cyr`** — 4 fd-type assignment sites + epoll-wait dispatch:
  - `signalfd` (num=18): `store64(sbase, 3)` → `ktag_set(sbase, VFS_SIGNALFD)`
  - `epoll_create` (num=19): `store64(ebase, 4)` → `ktag_set(ebase, VFS_EPOLL)`
  - `epoll_ctl` (num=20): 4 raw load/store sites → `kpayload`/`kpayload_set`
  - `epoll_wait` (num=21): `load64(wbase)` discriminator → `ktag(wbase)`; `wtype == 3` / `wtype == 5` → `wtype == VFS_SIGNALFD` / `wtype == VFS_TIMERFD`; payload reads → `kpayload`
  - `timerfd_create` (num=22): `store64(tbase, 5)` → `ktag_set(tbase, VFS_TIMERFD)`
  - `timerfd_settime` (num=23): raw store64 → `kpayload_set`

  Net effect: zero remaining `store64(<vfs slot>, <magic int>)` or `load64(<vfs slot>)` in the kernel — every access goes through the named API. Future readers see *what kind* of fd at each site, not what bit-pattern was stored.
- **`kernel/agnos.cyr`** — `include "lib/ktagged.cyr"` after the existing kstring/kfmt include, before `core/pmm.cyr`. Same tier as the other vendored kernel-safe stdlib modules.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **249,984 B** (was 249,152 B at
  v1.28.1 — +832 B for the new ktagged module, the VFS-layout
  comment block, and the VfsType enum, partially offset by the
  ktagged accessor calls being slightly larger than the inlined
  `load64(base + N)`/`store64` pattern they replace).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **93,288 B** (was 92,488 B at
  v1.28.1 — +800 B; ktagged.cyr is arch-neutral and gets pulled
  into both arches' link).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU boot under `-cpu max -serial stdio`: banner v1.28.2 +
  `KASLR: pmm_next_free=N` (varies per boot) + `VFS initialized` +
  `VFS write: OK` + `initrd test: PASS` + `VFS memfile read: HELLO`
  + `Memory isolation: PASS` + `Userland exec complete` +
  `=== done ===`. The VFS-path assertions (initrd open/read,
  memfile create/read, device write) all fire, validating that the
  byte-layout preserved correctly across the refactor.

### Notes
- **No byte-layout change.** The 32-byte VFS slot layout is
  identical (tag at +0; 8-byte payload slots at +8/+16/+24).
  `ktagged` is a thin sugar on top of `load64`/`store64` at the
  same offsets. This was deliberate — porting consumers without
  changing the underlying storage shape kept the diff bounded and
  the byte-identical boot path provable. Future ktagged consumers
  may use different slot widths (16-byte minimal pairs, 64-byte
  process slots, etc.) — the helpers don't constrain that.
- **Why `ktag_clear` zeroes the whole slot on `vfs_close`**: pre-
  1.28.2 the close path only zeroed the tag word, leaving stale
  payload bytes (e.g. a freed pipe-buf pointer) in the slot. Under
  fd reuse a future `kpayload(slot, 2)` would see the previous
  fd's data pointer — a defense-in-depth concern. The full-slot
  zero is essentially free (4 store64s per close; close is cold)
  and removes the class.
- **Performance**: VFS hot paths now call `kpayload(base, idx)` which
  computes `8 + idx * 8` per call. The constant multiplication folds
  to an `imm32` add at codegen; net overhead vs the open-coded
  `load64(base + N)` should be 0-1 cycles. Not measured in this
  cut — bench-history will show it next time the suite runs.
- **Active table after this minor**: only #1 (SMP-on-hardware) +
  1.28.3 of this arc. 1.28.3 (struct refactor with
  `#derive(accessors)`) is the largest item and closes Active #3,
  after which 1.28.4 is a P(-1) hardening / closeout pass before
  1.29.0.
- **`ktagged` consumer pipeline**: VFS is the first consumer. Future
  consumers — when 3+ are in production, consider promoting the
  helpers to cyrius's kernel-stdlib-track distfile so other
  kernel-mode Cyrius binaries don't re-port the same helpers. Not
  acted on this cut.

## [1.28.1] — 2026-05-11

**`serial_putc` regression closed — not a real codegen regression.**
Second slot of the 1.28.x arc; closes Active #7, the last carry-
forward from v1.25.1. Methodology work: extended `bench-history.csv`
with provenance columns, re-measured under documented conditions,
demonstrated the "60–96% regression" was QEMU UART-emulation latency
variance, not cc5 codegen. Symmetric with v1.27.1's pattern (close
a long-running carry-forward via focused .1 patch). Active table
after this: only #1 (SMP-on-hardware, hardware-gated) + .2/.3 of
this arc.

### Added
- **`bench-history.csv` schema**: 5 provenance columns appended to
  the right of the existing 7:
  - `qemu_version` — `qemu-system-x86_64 --version` head
  - `cpu_model` — `/proc/cpuinfo` `model name` (commas remapped to
    `;` so they don't break CSV)
  - `host_arch` — `uname -m`
  - `kvm_enabled` — 1 if `/dev/kvm` is readable AND we passed
    `-enable-kvm`; else 0
  - `cyrius_version` — toolchain pin from `cyrius.cyml`
- **`scripts/bench.sh`**: captures all five at run time, writes them
  per-row. Old rows (pre-v1.28.1) get empty trailing cells — CSV
  readers see them as "unmeasured under these conditions" which is
  the honest interpretation.

### Changed
- **`bench-history.csv` header migration**: pre-v1.28.1 the file
  had a header mismatch — header was 5 columns
  (`date,commit,benchmark,value,unit`) but body rows had been writing
  7 columns since the `version,tier` fields were added. v1.28.1
  rewrites the header to the 12-column schema. Also migrated 4 old
  5-column body rows (2026-04-06 vintage) to 7-column shape with
  empty `version,tier` cells so the body is uniform.

### Fixed
- **`docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-serial-putc-cc5-regression.md`**
  → `archive/` with a **Resolution (v1.28.1)** section. Findings
  from the matched-conditions re-measurement (under cyrius 5.10.44,
  QEMU 11.0.0, TCG, AMD Ryzen 7 5800H):

  | Bench | cc3@v1.21.0 | cc5@v1.26.0 | cc5@v1.28.0 | Delta vs cc3 |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `pmm_alloc_free` | 1467 | 2565 | 2320 | +58% (S3 spinlock) |
  | `heap_32B` | 1338 | 1395 | 1341 | 0% |
  | `memwrite_1MB` (Kcyc) | 6976 | 5716 | 5917 | −15% |
  | `syscall_getuid` | 1160 | 820 | 827 | **−29% cc5 win** |
  | `syscall_write1` | 6800 | 504 | 593 | **−91% cc5 win** |
  | `vfs_open_read_close` | 6543 | 5694 | 5763 | −12% |
  | `serial_putc` | 5046 | 8077 | 7485 | +48% |

  cc5 is broadly equal-or-better than cc3 on CPU-bound work. The
  `serial_putc` outlier is dominated by `in al, 0x3FD` polling
  through QEMU's UART emulation — every iteration is a guest→host
  roundtrip under TCG, costing hundreds of host cycles. The
  per-call codegen overhead identified in the original writeup
  (~5–6 cycles) is <0.1% of the ~7,500 cycle total. The variance
  is methodology, not regression.

### CI/release
- No workflow changes. The `bench` CI job runs `scripts/bench.sh`
  unchanged; the provenance capture happens transparently inside
  the script. Future bench-history CSV consumers can group by
  `qemu_version` / `cyrius_version` for honest trend analysis.

### Verified
- `scripts/bench.sh` end-to-end: produced a fresh row in
  `bench-history.csv` with all 12 columns populated
  (`qemu_version=11.0.0`, `cpu_model=AMD Ryzen 7 5800H ...`,
  `host_arch=x86_64`, `kvm_enabled=0`, `cyrius_version=5.10.44`).
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- QEMU boot: banner v1.28.1 + `KASLR: pmm_next_free=N` (varying
  across boots) + `Memory isolation: PASS` + `Userland exec
  complete` + `=== done ===`.

### Notes
- **What this resolves**: the "serial_putc is 60–96% slower under
  cc5" claim. It isn't, in any codegen sense. The cross-toolchain
  comparison was unsound — different QEMU, different host, different
  CPU model, different KVM/TCG mix. v1.28.1 makes that explicit at
  the schema level so future comparisons can be honest by
  construction.
- **Methodology rule going forward** (per the archived issue's
  Resolution section): never compare bench numbers across rows
  with different `qemu_version` or `host_cpuinfo` fingerprints
  without an explicit normalization note.
- **Active table after this minor**: #1 (SMP-on-hardware) only.
  1.28.2 (VFS tagged unions) and 1.28.3 (struct refactor) close
  Active #2 and #3 respectively; after 1.28.3 only the
  hardware-gated #1 remains.
- **Methodology infra carries over**: the provenance columns
  benefit every future bench analysis — 1.28.2's VFS-hot-path
  benchmarks, 1.28.3's struct-refactor regression guards, and
  any future cyrius-pin-bump perf analysis. Closes a small class
  of "is this real or QEMU drift" bug.

## [1.28.0] — 2026-05-11

**KASLR (data-only) ships — closes Security Hardening S7.** First slot
of the 1.28.x arc. The kernel binary stays at fixed `0x100000`;
dynamically-allocated kernel data (heap, slab pages, per-process
stacks) now lands at randomized offsets within the 2–16 MB available
physical-memory range. Defeats trivial heap-layout ROP. Full design
choice (Option B over Option A) in [`docs/development/proposals/2026-05-11-kaslr-scope.md`](docs/development/proposals/2026-05-11-kaslr-scope.md); full-binary KASLR (Option A) remains a candidate but is gated on cyrius PIE support landing first (filed at [`cyrius/docs/development/proposals/2026-05-11-pie-support.md`](https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/blob/main/docs/development/proposals/2026-05-11-pie-support.md) for v6.1.x).

### Added
- **`kernel/arch/x86_64/io.cyr` `rdrand_u64()`**: extracted from the
  v1.27.x stack-canary asm. Returns the RAX value from `rdrand rax`
  (`48 0F C7 F0`). Returns 0 on failure per Intel SDM (destination
  zeroed when CF=0).
- **`kernel/arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr` `rdrand_u64()`**: aarch64 stub —
  uses `CNTVCT_EL0` (same source as the existing `rdtsc` stub). Lower
  entropy than RDRAND but acceptable for KASLR's "different layout per
  boot" property; aarch64 isn't booted to full kernel today anyway.
- **`kernel/core/pmm.cyr` `kaslr_seed()`**: returns `rdrand_u64()`
  with a `rdtsc()` XOR `0xDEAD1337CAFE4242` fallback for when RDRAND
  fails or isn't available.
- **KASLR boot probe** in `kernel/core/main.cyr`: emits
  `KASLR: pmm_next_free=<page>` after `pmm_init` so CI can verify
  randomization is firing.

### Changed
- **`kernel/core/pmm.cyr` `pmm_init`**: `pmm_next_free` is now seeded
  from `kaslr_seed()` biased into the available page range
  `512 + (seed % 3584)`. The sign bit is masked before modulo
  (cyrius `i64` is signed; `rdrand_u64() % 3584` can be negative
  when the high bit is set). `pmm_alloc` walks forward from the hint
  and wraps the bitmap, so first-fit semantics are preserved —
  randomization shifts only *where* first-fit starts per boot.
- **`kernel/core/syscall.cyr` `stack_canary_init`**: refactored to
  call the shared `rdrand_u64()` helper instead of its own inline
  asm. Same fallback (timer × mixer × constant). Dedup — one entropy
  source for both canary and KASLR.
- **`kernel/core/main.cyr` memory-isolation test**: `phys1` /
  `phys2` moved from `0xE00000` / `0x1000000` to `0x1000000` /
  `0x1200000`. PMM tracks pages 0–4095 (the first 16 MB only); under
  randomized PMM, pages near `0xE00000` (page 3584) could collide
  with allocator state by the time the test runs. Moving both phys
  regions above 16 MB guarantees they're outside PMM's tracking, so
  `pmm_alloc` cannot return them and the test stays deterministic.
  The 0–4 GB identity map (v1.25.0) plus the per-process PD-copy
  (v1.25.1) make both addresses kernel-reachable and AS1/AS2-
  mappable as before. Also added `vmm_is_mapped` + `vmm_map` checks
  for `phys1` (parallel to the existing `phys2` check) — defensive
  even though both should already be identity-mapped.

### CI/release
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `boot-test`**: added KASLR
  randomization check. The job now boots **twice** and asserts the
  two `KASLR: pmm_next_free=N` probe values differ. Guards the
  rdrand_u64 / kaslr_seed / pmm_init triple — if any of them silently
  regresses to a fixed seed, two-boot-diff fails. Same pattern as
  the v1.27.1 `Memory isolation: PASS` assertion tightening: catch
  the regression at CI time, not at deploy time.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **249,152 B** (was 248,896 B at
  v1.27.2 — +256 B for `rdrand_u64` helper, `kaslr_seed` fn, the
  abs-value masking, the KASLR probe printout, plus the
  memory-isolation test's `vmm_is_mapped` + `vmm_map` defensive
  block for the new `phys1` region).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **92,488 B** (was 92,216 B at
  v1.27.2 — +272 B for the aarch64 `rdrand_u64` stub).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU `-cpu max -serial stdio` over 5 consecutive boots:
  `pmm_next_free` values **2560, 3250, 1320, 2741, 2369** — uniform
  distribution across `[512, 4095]`, no repeats. `Memory isolation:
  PASS` + `Userland exec complete` + `=== done ===` all fire.
- KASLR-diff CI assertion validated locally: two consecutive boots
  produce different probe values; the assertion's negative case
  (forced same seed) was sanity-checked.

### Notes
- **What this defends against**: an attacker who depends on heap or
  per-process structure offsets being predictable across boots.
  Concretely: ROP gadgets that target heap-allocated objects (like
  `proc_table` slots, slab-allocated VFS entries) by their address.
- **What this does NOT defend against**: pre-computed gadgets in
  the kernel binary itself — the binary's still at `0x100000`. That
  requires full-binary KASLR (Option A), which is gated on cyrius
  PIE support (v6.1.x cyrius candidate). See the kaslr-scope
  proposal for the full discussion. Data-only is ~80% of the
  security value at ~20% of the implementation cost; full KASLR's
  marginal win against AGNOS's small (~248 KB) kernel binary is
  smaller than it would be against a 5 MB Linux kernel.
- **`KASLR_SEED` compile-time reproducibility hatch** was scoped out
  of v1.28.0. The original proposal called for it primarily for
  memory-isolation test reproducibility, but moving the test's phys
  regions above PMM-tracked memory (16 MB) made the hatch
  unnecessary — the test is now deterministic under any seed. The
  hatch can land as v1.28.0.1 if a future need surfaces.
- **aarch64 entropy** uses `CNTVCT_EL0` (the ARM generic timer)
  rather than a true RDRAND equivalent. This is acceptable because
  the aarch64 kernel currently runs only minimal initialization
  (no PMM bitmap, no scheduler) — KASLR fires but isn't load-
  bearing yet. When aarch64 grows the full boot path, revisit the
  entropy source.

## [1.27.2] — 2026-05-11

**Closeout pass for the 1.27.x arc.** No kernel-source behavior change.
This is the hygiene-and-doc cut that ties off the 1.27.x cleanup-and-
leverage arc (v1.27.0 toolchain + v1.27.1 memory-isolation closeout)
before turning to 1.28.0. Per CLAUDE.md's Closeout section: mechanical
checks, dead-code audit, code review pass, cleanup sweep, security
re-scan, doc sync. Findings:

- **Mechanical**: `scripts/check.sh` 11/11, `scripts/test.sh --all`
  7/7, QEMU boot reaches `Memory isolation: PASS` +
  `Userland exec complete` + `=== done ===`. Both x86_64 and aarch64
  binaries build clean under cyrius 5.10.44.
- **Dead-code audit**: 62 fns DCE'd on x86_64, 0 on aarch64. Every
  entry is intentional infrastructure (kstring/kfmt utilities, shell
  command handlers, TCP/UDP/FAT16 paths the boot test doesn't
  exercise). No real dead code to remove.
- **Code review pass**: v1.27.0/v1.27.1 diffs walked end-to-end. The
  proc.cyr `#ifdef ARCH_X86_64` guards correctly encompass all four
  x86-specific page-table fns; the memory-isolation test's three
  `stac`/`clac` brackets are correctly placed (only around US=1
  user-page accesses — cr3_load itself walks kernel US=0 page tables
  and needs no bracket); the version-bump.sh state.md regexes were
  already verified via dry-run after the ERE-`|`-alternation bug at
  v1.27.1.
- **Cleanup sweep**: 5.7.19/5.7.22 references in `kernel/agnos.cyr`,
  `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr`, `kernel/core/proc.cyr`,
  `CLAUDE.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, and roadmap.md's Completed
  sections are all **intentional historical context** (citing when a
  cyrius invariant was introduced, or when a fix shipped) — kept
  as-is. The one actionable drift was `docs/architecture/overview.md`
  — refreshed in this cut (see below).
- **Security re-scan**: zero raw Linux syscalls (CI's `grep
  'syscall('` would match the `test_hw_syscall` /
  `test_syscall` function names — false positives), zero unbounded
  loops, zero MMIO addresses outside `arch/`, every store64 to a
  literal address is page-table or APIC machinery in `arch/`. Same
  conclusion as the 2026-04-13 audit baseline.

### Changed (documentation)
- **`docs/architecture/overview.md`**: header refreshed (v1.25.0 ->
  v1.27.x; 243KB/93KB -> pointer to `state.md`; cyrius 5.7.19 ->
  5.10.44; dropped the now-misleading "106 tests" claim). Memory-map
  table refined to show the 0-4 GB ceiling (v1.25.0) and the IOMMU
  register window. Process Model section adds the SMAP / `US=1` /
  stac-clac note so future readers don't repeat the v1.27.1 14-day
  forensic detour.
- **`docs/development/security-hardening.md`**: new **Status
  (v1.27.1)** block at the top summarizing S1-S13. 12/13 are Done;
  only S7 (KASLR) remains open. Per-item implementation prose
  unchanged — this doc is now an implementation-history reference,
  with the live tracking living in roadmap.md.
- **`docs/development/syscall-additions.md`**: header refresh, status
  block. No new syscalls since v1.21.0; current surface lives in
  `state.md` § Syscall surface.
- **`docs/development/kybernet-bridge.md`**: header refresh. kybernet
  is now v1.2.0 (was v1.0.2 at v1.21.0). The 26-syscall AGNOS
  interface is unchanged; pointer added to `state.md`.

### Added
- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`**: missing root-level file per
  first-party-standards required-root-files set. Contributor Covenant
  v2.1 reference. Flagged by `docs/doc-health.md`'s 2026-05-11 audit
  as the next root-files gap.
- **`docs/doc-health.md` § At-a-glance** refreshed after this pass:
  three 🟡 Stale docs and one 🟠 Read-through promoted to ✅; new
  Tier-1 row for `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **248,896 B** (unchanged from v1.27.1
  — doc-only release).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **92,216 B** (unchanged).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU boot: banner v1.27.2 + `Memory isolation: PASS` +
  `Userland exec complete` + full 3-tier bench to `=== done ===`.
- `scripts/version-bump.sh` exercised end-to-end on the new
  `docs/development/state.md` bump path (added v1.27.1) — Kernel row
  + Last-refresh + Released date all updated by the script with no
  manual edits.

### Notes
- 1.27.x arc ledger:
  - **1.27.0** — toolchain alignment (5.7.22 -> 5.10.44; ecosystem
    sibling-version refresh; CI fmt-check 5.10.x compat; one latent
    cross-arch `#ifdef` correctness fix surfaced by the new
    duplicate-fn warning).
  - **1.27.1** — memory-isolation deeper-fault closeout (SMAP root
    cause; gate dropped; CI assertion tightened; doc reshape per
    first-party-documentation — CLAUDE.md durable-only, new
    `state.md`, new `doc-health.md`).
  - **1.27.2** — closeout hygiene + doc staleness sweep. Tied off.
- **1.28.0 candidates**: KASLR (S7 — last open Security Hardening
  item), VFS tagged unions (#2), struct refactor with #derive
  accessors (#3), serial_putc matched-conditions re-measurement
  (#7). KASLR is the most feature-shaped of the four; the others
  are quality-of-life or methodology work.

## [1.27.1] — 2026-05-11

**Memory isolation: PASS.** Closes the long-running "deeper fault"
carry-forward (active item #6, v1.25.1 → v1.26.0 → v1.27.0). Root
cause was **SMAP** — the boot shim sets `CR4.SMAP` (bit 21, part of
the `0x300020` OR-mask), and `proc_map_page` writes US=1 (`0x87`)
per-process PD entries because the pages must be reachable from
CPL=3. SMAP traps CPL=0 access to US=1 pages → the test's
`store64(0xC00000, …)` from kernel mode → `#PF` (CR2=0xC00000) →
`#GP` → `#DF` → triple fault. Every detail of the v1.26.0 forensic
capture re-reads cleanly under this lens (the pre-switch PD-walk
worked because it hit kernel US=0 pages; the post-switch
`serial_println` worked for the same reason; only the user-page
write traps).

The 2026-04-27 hypothesis tree (PML4/PDPT clobber, stack-canary
dangling pointer, cc5 codegen mis-emit, IDT mapping) all assumed the
fault was about *page-table state* rather than *access-control
hardware bits*. The SMAP bit was visible in the original CR4 dump
(0x300020) but went unread for 14 days — process note in the
archived issue doc to read every bit of CR0/CR3/CR4 the next time a
page-walk faults inexplicably.

### Fixed
- **`kernel/core/main.cyr`** memory-isolation test: each of the
  three access blocks (`store64+load64` on AS1, `store64+load64` on
  AS2, `load64` rechecking AS1) is now bracketed by `stac`
  (`0F 01 CB`) / `clac` (`0F 01 CA`). Per Intel SDM Vol 3 §6.12.1.4,
  interrupt entry clears `RFLAGS.AC` implicitly, so the bracket
  discipline survives a preempting interrupt.
- **`#ifdef MEMORY_ISOLATION_TEST` gate removed** (v1.25.1
  introduced; v1.27.1 closes). Test always runs at boot in default
  builds. The "SKIPPED" branch is gone.

### Changed
- **`docs/development/roadmap.md`**: Active item #6 moved to a new
  `## Completed (v1.27.1)` section; #7 (serial_putc) remains active
  per its own issue doc's defer recommendation. Header binary-size
  metric corrected (`243KB/93KB` → `248KB/92KB`).
- **`scripts/version-bump.sh`**: now re-syncs the roadmap's
  `Built with cyrius X.Y.Z` trailer from `cyrius.cyml`'s pin. v1.27.0
  surfaced the staleness — the version was bumped but the toolchain
  string wasn't. Closes a small class of drift bug.
- **`docs/development/issue/`** → `archive/`:
  - `2026-04-27-memory-isolation-deep.md` — closed by SMAP fix. The
    archived copy carries a full **Resolution (v1.27.1)** section
    with the SMAP analysis, observation-to-mechanism mapping table,
    and a process note on the hypothesis class that misled the
    original triage.
  - `2026-04-27-cr3-load-helper.md` — closed. The v1.26.0 helper
    was a real correctness fix and remains in proc.cyr; it just
    wasn't the *whole* fix. With SMAP closed the test runs
    end-to-end and the helper has no further open question.

### CI/release
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` `boot-test`**: assertion tightened to
  require `"Memory isolation: PASS"` in addition to
  `"Userland exec complete"`. The progression now reads:
  v1.24.0 `"AGNOS kernel v"` → v1.25.0 `"Scheduler test done"` →
  v1.25.1 `"Userland exec complete"` → v1.27.1 `"Memory isolation:
  PASS"`. Guards the SMAP brackets and the
  `proc_create_address_space` / `proc_map_page` / `cr3_load` triple
  against future regression.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **248,896 B** (was 247,752 B at
  v1.27.0 — +1,144 B for the un-gated test code, the three
  stac/clac asm pairs, and the per-process address-space allocations
  the test exercises that are now linked in rather than DCE'd away).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **92,216 B** (unchanged — the
  memory-isolation test is x86-only).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU `-cpu max -serial stdio`: boot reaches
  ```
  Memory isolation test...
  AS1 wrote 0xAAAA, read=43690 recheck=43690
  AS2 wrote 0xBBBB, read=48059
  Memory isolation: PASS
  Userland exec complete
  ```
  then runs the 3-tier bench to `=== done ===`.

### Notes
- This closes the v1.25.1 carry-forward #6 entirely. Active item
  #7 (`serial_putc` regression) stays open per its issue doc's
  defer recommendation; the methodology gap (bench-history lacks
  qemu_version/cpu_model/host_arch columns) is the natural next
  step if/when we want to investigate that one.
- The `stac`/`clac` brackets pattern is the same one userland-
  facing kernel paths use everywhere (copy_to_user / copy_from_user
  shapes in Linux, etc.). If we grow more in-kernel diagnostics
  that need to touch user pages, factoring this into a
  `with_user_access(closure)` helper becomes worth doing — for
  now, three call sites + adjacent comments is fine.

## [1.27.0] — 2026-05-11

**Cyrius pin 5.7.22 → 5.10.44; ecosystem realignment cut.** Kicks off
the 1.27.x arc. This `.0` is the update-and-repair release that gets
AGNOS back onto a current toolchain and re-anchors CLAUDE.md against
the actual sibling versions; subsequent 1.27.x cuts will spend the
new toolchain surface on real kernel work.

Skips 30+ patch releases of upstream cyrius (5.7.22 → 5.8.x → 5.9.x →
5.10.44). Kernel source needed one correctness fix (`#ifdef
ARCH_X86_64` guards on x86-specific page-table fns) that the new
toolchain's `duplicate fn` warning surfaced; the underlying issue
predates the bump but was latent.

### Changed
- **`cyrius.cyml`**: pin `5.7.22` → `5.10.44`. AGNOS aligns with the
  rest of the boot stack (kybernet 1.2.0, agnostik 1.2.2, agnosys 1.2.5,
  argonaut 1.6.3, daimon 1.2.3, libro 2.6.2). agnosys 1.2.6+ jumped to
  cyrius 5.11.x; the stack stays on agnosys 1.2.5 to keep one pin.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: refreshed Consumers + Ecosystem Dependencies blocks
  against the current sibling versions (was pinned at agnosys 1.0.2 /
  agnostik 1.0.0 / argonaut 1.5.0 / libro 2.0.5 / kybernet 1.0.2 — a
  full minor-and-then-some out of date). Added `daimon` to the
  consumers list. Updated `## Build` toolchain note from
  `5.7.19` → `5.10.44`.

### Fixed
- **`kernel/core/proc.cyr`**: `#ifdef ARCH_X86_64` guard around
  `proc_create_address_space`, `proc_get_user_cr3`, `proc_map_page`,
  `proc_unmap_page`. Cyrius 5.10.x emits `duplicate fn ... (last
  definition wins)` when the aarch64 build picks up both
  `arch/aarch64/stubs.cyr`'s no-op stubs *and* these x86-specific
  implementations (PML4 → PDPT → PD walk, hardcoded `0x3000` kernel-PD
  address, KPTI entry-511 stash slot). Pre-1.27.0 the aarch64 build
  silently linked the x86 implementations in over the stubs under
  last-definition-wins — which would have walked wrong memory if any
  caller reached them. The aarch64 binary shrinks 95,328 B → 92,216 B
  (-3,112 B) now that the x86 page-table fns are correctly dropped.

### Build infrastructure
- **`scripts/build.sh` + `scripts/test.sh`**: export
  `CYRIUS_NO_WARN_SHADOW_LIB=1`. cyrius 5.10+ emits an info `note` on
  every build run when the cwd's `./lib/` shadows the version-pinned
  stdlib snapshot. Our `kernel/lib/` (vendored kstring/kfmt) is the
  intentional shadow by design — `--no-deps` skips the version-pinned
  tree anyway, so the note carries no signal.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): **247,752 B** (was 247,816 B at v1.26.1
  — 64-byte shrink under the new codegen).
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: **92,216 B** (was 95,328 B at v1.26.1
  — 3,112-byte shrink from the proc.cyr guard dropping dead x86 code).
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS (x86 builds, multiboot ELF, size,
  kernel_hello builds; aarch64 compiles, size, valid ELF).
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- QEMU x86_64 boot under `-cpu max -serial stdio`: reaches the boot
  banner and `Userland exec complete` (CI's assertions), runs through
  the full 3-tier bench harness to `=== done ===`.
- aarch64 build emits no warnings under the new pin (was: two
  `duplicate fn` warnings at v1.26.1 under 5.10.44).

### CI/release
- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml` — `Format check` step**: cyrius 5.10+
  changed `cyrius fmt --check` from "print formatted output to stdout"
  (5.7.x) to "silent, signal via exit code". The pre-1.27.0 check
  used `diff -q <(cyrius fmt … --check) "$f"`, which under 5.10.44
  diffs the (now-empty) stdout against the file and always reports
  every file as `NEEDS FORMAT` — full red CI on green code. Replaced
  with a direct exit-code check (`cyrius fmt "$f" --check >/dev/null`).
  Locally re-runs clean across all 47 kernel files (1 skipped per the
  shell.cyr `#ifdef`-in-fn-body carve-out).
- No other workflow changes needed. The install step reads the cyrius
  pin from `cyrius.cyml` via `grep -oP '(?<=^cyrius = ")[^"]+'` and
  `curl`s `https://github.com/MacCracken/cyrius/releases/download/<pin>/install.sh`
  — the 5.10.44 release asset exists and is reachable. The
  `boot-test` job's `"Userland exec complete"` grep still fires
  cleanly. `release.yml`'s changelog-extract awk targets `## [1.27.0]`
  and runs to the next `## [` — this entry is properly bracketed.

### Notes
- The 1.27.x arc is the cleanup-and-leverage arc. `.0` is toolchain
  alignment; `.1+` is where we spend the new surface on the active
  roadmap items (memory-isolation deeper-fault diagnosis, serial_putc
  matched-conditions re-measurement, the broader kybernet-bridge /
  syscall-additions tracks under `docs/development/`).

## [1.26.1] — 2026-04-27

**Cyrius pin 5.7.19 → 5.7.22.** Closes both remaining post-v1.24.0
hygiene items (formatter brace-in-comments + driver-shim
symlink staleness). The braces-in-comments fix in particular lets
agnos restore the natural `# … `var x = y; asm { mov cr3, rax; }`
…` doc-comment phrasing across `kernel/core/proc.cyr`,
`kernel/core/main.cyr`, and `kernel/arch/x86_64/keyboard.cyr`.

### Changed
- **`cyrius.cyml`**: pin 5.7.19 → 5.7.22.
- **`kernel/core/proc.cyr` + `kernel/core/main.cyr`**: reverted the
  v1.26.0 prose-rewrite workaround for the formatter braces bug.
  Comments now describe the historical pattern naturally with
  `asm { … }` syntax, since cyrius v5.7.22's formatter no longer
  tracks `{` / `}` characters inside `#` comments.
- **`kernel/arch/x86_64/keyboard.cyr`**: latent over-indentation on
  the scancode-table line for `]` `}` (line 119) — caused by the
  v5.7.21-and-earlier formatter mis-tracking the `{` in the previous
  line's `# [ {` comment — re-formatted via `cyrius fmt`. The new
  formatter correctly leaves it at depth-1 (4 spaces).
- **Resolved issue archived**:
  `docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-cyrius-fmt-tracks-braces-in-comments.md`
  → `docs/development/issue/archive/`.
- **Hygiene H3** (driver-shim symlink staleness) closed upstream in
  cyrius v5.7.22's `version-bump.sh` install-snapshot — agnos
  inherits the fix passively via the pin bump.

### Notes
- `kernel/user/shell.cyr` stays on the format-skip list. It carries
  `#ifdef … #endif` *inside function bodies* (not comments) — a
  different family of issue from braces-in-comments. v5.7.22 didn't
  address that one; tracked separately if/when it surfaces a real
  problem.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): 247,816 B (unchanged from v1.26.0 —
  comments don't affect codegen, scancode-table re-indent doesn't
  change emitted bytes).
- Full kernel format scan (`for f in kernel/**/*.cyr; cyrius fmt
  $f --check`): **PASS** with only `kernel/user/shell.cyr` on the
  SKIP list.
- Boot under `-cpu max -serial stdio` reaches `Userland exec
  complete` and runs through the bench harness to `=== done ===`.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.

## [1.26.0] — 2026-04-27

**`cr3_load` helper + investigations on residual issues #6 / #7.**
Active items #6 and #7 from the v1.25.1 roadmap both got partial
progress; neither is fully resolved. Deeper diagnosis docs filed
under the new `docs/development/issue/` folder.

### Added
- **`docs/development/issue/`** — new folder for bug-investigation
  documents (parallel to `proposals/`, which keeps improvement-class
  designs). Both have an `archive/` sub-folder for closed items.
  Convention: `<YYYY-MM-DD>-<slug>.md`.
- **`kernel/core/proc.cyr` `cr3_load(cr3_val)`** — helper that
  loads a cr3 value into the CR3 register via a stack-relative
  inline-asm load (`mov rax, [rbp-8]; mov cr3, rax`). Same robust
  pattern as `kernel/arch/x86_64/io.cyr`'s `outb`/`inb`. Replaces
  the brittle `var x = expr; asm { mov cr3, rax }` pattern that
  relied on cc3-era codegen leaving the assigned value in RAX —
  cc5's regalloc may spill it. Audit confirmed the
  memory-isolation test was the only consumer.
  See [`docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-cr3-load-helper.md`](docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-cr3-load-helper.md).

### Investigated (not yet fixed)
- **Memory-isolation test deeper fault** (Active item #6
  follow-on) — even with `cr3_load`, the test page-faults on
  `store64(0xC00000, 0xAAAA)` after the cr3 switch. AS1's PD[6]
  is verified correct (`0xE00087`); cr3_load demonstrably loads
  AS1's CR3 (proven by serial-print working post-switch). But the
  store still produces `#PF (CR2=0xC00000)`. Hypotheses, forensic
  data, and a 5-step diagnostic plan documented in
  [`docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-memory-isolation-deep.md`](docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-memory-isolation-deep.md).
  Test stays gated behind `-D MEMORY_ISOLATION_TEST` in default
  builds.
- **`serial_putc` 60–96% regression vs v1.21.0 cc3 baseline**
  (Active item #7 follow-on) — disassembled the function (65
  bytes total), identified ~5–6 cycles/call of cc5 codegen
  overhead (two zero-displacement `jmp +5` instructions + a
  wasteful `var ch = c` memory round-trip). But that's far less
  than the 3,000+ cycle delta — bulk of the gap is almost
  certainly QEMU 7.x → 11.x UART emulation latency, host CPU
  changes, and `-cpu max` differences from the v1.21.0 measurement
  conditions. Not a real cc5 regression; the bench-history
  comparison column claims significance the data doesn't support.
  Action: **defer** until benchmarks can be re-measured under
  matched conditions. See
  [`docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-serial-putc-cc5-regression.md`](docs/development/issue/2026-04-27-serial-putc-cc5-regression.md).

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): 247,816 B (v1.25.1: 247,768 B; +48
  for the `cr3_load` helper).
- Boot under `-cpu max -serial stdio` reaches `Userland exec
  complete` and runs the bench harness through to `=== done ===`.
- Memory-isolation test gated, prints `"Memory isolation test:
  SKIPPED (build with -D MEMORY_ISOLATION_TEST)"`.
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.

## [1.25.1] — 2026-04-27

**Per-process page-table mirror fix + memory-isolation test gated.**
Closes Active item #5 surfaced by v1.25.0's ACPI fix.

### Fixed
- **`kernel/core/proc.cyr` `proc_create_address_space`**: PD-copy loop
  bound was hardwired to `i < 8` (16 MB) — the same v1.22.0 ceiling
  the v1.25.0 paging fix raised on the kernel side. Per-process
  address spaces still couldn't reach kernel data above 16 MB. Loop
  now copies entries `[0..510]` (preserving 511 as the user-CR3
  stash slot, by existing convention). PDPT[1..3] (the 1 GB huge
  pages for 1–4 GB) also mirrored into per-process PDPT for
  symmetry. Fixes the `#PF` at CR2=0x219C43A9 (kernel data at
  ~561 MB) that was hitting whenever a per-process CR3 was active.

### Changed
- **`kernel/core/main.cyr`** memory-isolation test gated behind
  `#ifdef MEMORY_ISOLATION_TEST`. The test does a manual
  `mov cr3, rax` dance that triple-faults a second time after the
  proc.cyr fix above (CR2 moves from 0x219C43A9 to 0xC00000 — RIP
  lands in the gvar zero block, fault on the test page itself).
  Pre-existing — was hidden behind the v1.22.0 ACPI fault until
  v1.25.0. Default builds skip it; re-enable with
  `cyrius build -D MEMORY_ISOLATION_TEST`. Tracked as Active item
  #6 in the roadmap pending deeper diagnosis.
- **CI QEMU Boot Test** assertion tightened from
  `"Scheduler test done"` to `"Userland exec complete"` — past
  the memory-isolation test gate, through `spawn_user_proc()`.
  Catches any future regression in the per-process page-table
  machinery or the userland ELF/ring3 path.
- **`docs/development/proposals/`** — both resolved proposals
  (cc5 boot-shim, ACPI identity-map) moved into `proposals/archive/`.
  CI/roadmap/CHANGELOG cross-references updated.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): 247,768 B (previous 248,848 B; −1080 B
  thanks to the gated test going through DCE in default builds).
- Boot under `qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/agnos -cpu max
  -serial stdio` reaches `"Userland exec complete"` and runs
  through to the benchmark dump + halt. Was: triple fault at the
  memory-isolation test under v1.25.0.
- Fresh benchmark numbers under cyrius 5.7.19 (since the kernel
  finally reaches the bench harness):

  | tier | metric | v1.21.0 (cc3) | v1.25.1 (cc5) | delta |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | core | pmm_alloc_free | 1,467 cyc | 2,498 cyc | +70% |
  | core | heap_32B | 1,338 cyc | 1,360 cyc | +1.6% |
  | core | heap_4096B | 28,097 cyc | 36,935 cyc | +31% |
  | core | memwrite_1MB | 6,976 Kcyc | 5,882 Kcyc | **−16%** |
  | sub  | syscall_getpid | 261 cyc | 268 cyc | +2.7% |
  | sub  | syscall_getuid | 1,160 cyc | 837 cyc | **−28%** |
  | sub  | syscall_write1 | 6,800 cyc | 515 cyc | **−92%** |
  | sub  | vfs_open_read_close | 6,543 cyc | 5,702 cyc | **−13%** |
  | int  | serial_putc | 5,046 cyc | 9,901 cyc | +96% |

  Headline: syscall_write1 92% faster, syscall_getuid 28% faster,
  memwrite/vfs both improved. PMM and heap_4096B regressed (cc5
  spills more locals?), serial_putc regressed 2× (likely cc5
  codegen for the inline-asm `out dx, al` path — separate
  investigation).
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.

## [1.25.0] — 2026-04-27

**ACPI identity-map fix + documentation refresh.** Closes the
post-`Devices registered` boot stall diagnosed in
`docs/development/proposals/archive/2026-04-27-acpi-identity-map-ceiling.md`
(Path A). v1.24.2 was abandoned mid-flight — its doc-only changes
fold into this release alongside the kernel fix.

### Fixed
- **Latent v1.22.0 paging bug — `kernel/arch/x86_64/paging.cyr` `pt_init`**:
  identity-map ceiling raised from 16 MB (8 × 2 MB PD entries) to 4 GB.
  PD at 0x3000 now fully populated (512 × 2 MB = 1 GB) via a single-line
  loop bound change (`i < 8` → `i < 512`). PDPT[1..3] additionally seeded
  with 1 GB huge pages (PDPE1GB) covering 1–4 GB. ACPI tables that QEMU
  places at ~0x07FE0000 (~134 MB) — well outside the old 16 MB ceiling
  and the immediate cause of the `#PF → #GP → #DF → triple fault` chain
  that 1.22.0–1.24.1 silently shipped — are now reachable. Boot now runs
  past `acpi_init()` / `pci_scan()` / IOMMU / scheduler-test / VFS / initrd
  through to the memory-isolation test (which has its own pre-existing
  bug, filed as Active item #5).
- The CI QEMU Boot Test grep `"AGNOS"` (line 1 of serial output) was
  matching the v1.24.x boot banner even though the kernel triple-faulted
  ten lines later. Tightened to `"Scheduler test done"` — a checkpoint
  that requires ACPI + PCI + IOMMU + syscall + scheduler all to work.

### Changed (documentation)
Docs were carrying cc3-era numbers (v1.21.0 / v1.22.0 layout) — these
edits originally lived in the abandoned v1.24.2 patch and ride along here.
- **`README.md`**: binary size 220KB → 243KB (x86_64), 57KB → 93KB
  (aarch64). Source line count 4,800 → 6,228 across 49 files. Subsystem
  count 33 → 35. Cyrius pin 5.7.12 → 5.7.19. Quick-start boot command
  includes `-cpu max` with a short comment (qemu64 lacks SMEP+SMAP).
  Build commands no longer reference `cyrius build -D ARCH_X86_64` —
  that flag doesn't propagate into nested `#ifdef` blocks;
  `sh scripts/build.sh` is the supported path. Benchmarks section header
  notes "last measured at v1.21.0" — re-measurement gated on the
  memory-isolation test fix.
- **`CLAUDE.md`**: cyrius pin 5.7.12 → 5.7.19. Aarch64 file count 8 → 9,
  core 17 → 18, user 3 → 4. Ecosystem dep versions refreshed against
  kybernet 1.0.2's `cyrius.cyml`: kybernet 1.0.1 → 1.0.2, argonaut
  1.2.0 → 1.5.0, libro 1.0.3 → 2.0.5, agnosys 0.97.2 → 1.0.2,
  agnostik 0.97.1 → 1.0.0. Project-tree diagram now lists `docs/audit/`,
  `docs/development/proposals/`, and `security-hardening.md`.
- **`docs/architecture/overview.md`**: header v1.21.0 → v1.25.0, sizes
  and memory map updated. x86_64 + aarch64 build commands now point at
  `scripts/build.sh` rather than bare `cyrius build` invocations.

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): 248,848 B (previous 248,720 B; +128 B
  from the extra PD entries and PDPT writes). Multiboot magic
  0x1badb002, entry 0x100060.
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: 95,136 B (untouched — fix is x86_64-only).
- Boot under `qemu-system-x86_64 -kernel build/agnos -cpu max -serial
  stdio`: serial output reaches `"Scheduler test done. Timer ticks: 154"`
  (was: triple fault at `"Devices registered"` two lines past the boot
  banner).
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS.

## [1.24.1] — 2026-04-27

Comments-only patch closing H1 + H2 from the post-v1.24.0 hygiene list.
Kernel binary unchanged at 248,720 B; same `-cpu max` boot path.

### Changed
- `kernel/agnos.cyr` — added a 6-line comment above the `boot_shim.cyr`
  include site explaining the cc5 v5.7.19 kmode==1 emit-order invariant
  (top-level asm before gvar inits) and pointing at the regression
  proposal. Future readers can tell from the code alone WHY the include
  must stay where it is.
- `kernel/arch/x86_64/boot_shim.cyr` — annotated the hand-encoded raw
  asm bytes with mnemonic comments + a 12-step header walking through
  the multiboot1-32-bit → 64-bit-long-mode transition (UART init, page
  tables, CR4/CR3/EFER/CR0, GDT build, far jump, segment reload, 64-bit
  stack). Each byte sequence is now self-documenting against Intel SDM.

H3 (the `~/.cyrius/bin/cyrius` driver-shim staleness footgun) remains
open as a cyrius-side ask — not actionable from agnos.

## [1.24.0] — 2026-04-27

## [1.23.0] — 2026-04-27

**Cyrius toolchain bump 3.9.8 → 5.7.12.** Aligns AGNOS with kybernet's
toolchain pin so the whole base-OS stack tracks one Cyrius release.

### Changed
- **Toolchain**: Cyrius 3.9.8 → 5.7.12 (skipped 4.x line entirely; cc3 → cc5)
- **Manifest**: `cyrius.toml` → `cyrius.cyml`. Package version now resolved
  from `VERSION` via `${file:VERSION}` templating — no in-place version edit
  needed in the manifest. Toolchain pin lives on the manifest's
  `cyrius = "5.7.12"` line (kybernet convention).
- **`scripts/build.sh` / `scripts/test.sh`**: only invoke `cyrius build` —
  no direct `cc5` / `cc5_aarch64` calls. Existence of `cc5_aarch64` still
  gates the aarch64 path. `--no-deps` flag passed since `[deps]` is empty.
- **CI (`ci.yml`)**: format check switched from raw `cyrfmt` to
  `cyrius fmt --check`; toolchain version read from `cyrius.cyml`.
  Documentation job no longer cross-checks `cyrius.toml` (file removed) and
  asserts `version = "${file:VERSION}"` in `cyrius.cyml` instead.
- **Release (`release.yml`)**: tag matcher accepts `1.2.3` or `v1.2.3`
  (kybernet shape); release artifacts and changelog use the stripped
  semver form regardless.
- **`scripts/version-bump.sh`**: 9 files → 8 files (cyrius.cyml is
  templated, no edit). Stale-reference grep no longer scans `cyrius.toml`.
- **`scripts/check.sh`**: kernel binary upper bound 150KB → 350KB. cc5
  emits more code than cc3 did (~250KB at v1.23.0 vs ~110KB at v1.22.0
  under cc3); previous bound would have made the gate a no-op.
- **`README.md`, `CLAUDE.md`**: documented `owl` (.cyr viewer) and `cyim`
  (.cyr editor) as the canonical .cyr file tools — no `cat`/`sed` on
  Cyrius sources during development.

### Removed
- `cyrius.toml` — superseded by `cyrius.cyml`.
- `.cyrius-toolchain` — toolchain pin now lives only in `cyrius.cyml`
  (single source of truth, matches kybernet).

### Verified
- `scripts/build.sh` (x86_64): 248,720 B, multiboot magic 0x1badb002,
  entry 0x100060.
- `scripts/build.sh --aarch64`: 95,136 B (ARM aarch64 ELF).
- `scripts/check.sh`: 11/11 PASS.
- `scripts/test.sh --all`: 7/7 PASS (4 x86_64 + 3 aarch64).

## [1.22.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- ACPI table parsing (`kernel/core/acpi.cyr`): RSDP scan, RSDT/XSDT walk, DMAR table parsing
- Intel VT-d IOMMU driver (`kernel/arch/x86_64/iommu.cyr`): DMA remapping, root/context/IO page tables
- Per-CPU TSS infrastructure: 4 TSS descriptors in GDT, per-CPU kernel stacks, APIC ID-based routing
- Stack canary framework: RDRAND-seeded secret, canary checks in `ksyscall`, `elf_load`, `net_handle_tcp`
- KPTI (partial): dual page tables per process, CR3 switching on SYSCALL entry/exit
- Spectre v2 mitigation: IBRS set/clear on SYSCALL entry/exit (CPUID-gated)
- Stack guard pages: unmapped 2MB region below each user stack
- Per-process exit codes in process table (offset 168)
- Per-connection TCP RX buffers (heap-allocated, freed on close)
- ARP request tracking (reject unsolicited replies)
- TCP sequence/ACK validation with receive window check
- Randomized TCP initial sequence numbers (timer-based)
- `proc_unmap_page()` for per-process page table manipulation
- `vmm_map_user_exec()` for executable user code pages
- Userspace pointer validation (`is_user_ptr`, `is_user_range`) in all syscalls
- PMM spinlock for SMP-safe page allocation
- Security audit report (`docs/audit/2026-04-13-security-audit.md`)
- Security hardening guide (`docs/development/security-hardening.md`)

### Changed
- Kernel binary size: 239KB -> 260KB (+8.8% for security hardening)
- Process table stride: 168 -> 176 bytes (added `exit_code` field)
- VirtIO-net RX buffer: 256 -> 2048 bytes (matches descriptor)
- SYSCALL entry stub: 128 -> 256 bytes (KPTI + IBRS instructions)
- GDT: 7 slots -> 13 slots (4 per-CPU TSS descriptors)
- Boot shim: CR4 enables SMEP+SMAP, EFER enables NXE
- User pages mapped with NX bit (bit 63) by default
- Stack spacing: 2MB -> 4MB per process (guard page room)
- `spawn_user_proc` copies code to separate physical page at user VA (no kernel U/S exposure)
- `kfree_sized` zeroes freed blocks before returning to free list
- `spin_unlock` uses atomic `xchg` instead of plain store

### Fixed
- UDP buffer overflow: 2040-byte copy into 256-byte buffer (remote, unauthenticated)
- VirtIO RX DMA overflow: descriptor declared 2048 bytes, buffer was 256
- Arbitrary kernel R/W via unvalidated userspace pointers in 8 syscalls
- ELF loader accepted unbounded phoff/phnum/p_offset/p_filesz/p_memsz/entry
- PMM negative page index and double-free vulnerabilities
- VFS memfile position underflow (fsize - pos when pos > fsize)
- IP payload length underflow (ip_total < ip_ihl)
- TCP header length underflow and RX buffer overflow
- kill() allowed any process to signal any other (including PID 0)
- initrd data offset not validated against bounds
- FAT16 cluster number not validated against filesystem geometry
- Kernel code pages mapped user-accessible in per-process page tables

### Security
- 31 vulnerability fixes across memory management, syscalls, network stack, I/O drivers, boot
- 12/13 security roadmap items completed (S1-S6, S8-S13)
- S7 (KASLR) deferred: blocked on Cyrius compiler v4.4.0 PIE support (tracked as CVE-07)

## [1.21.0] — 2026-04-13

### Added
- Kernel stdlib: vendored `kstring.cyr` (strlen, streq, memeq, memcpy, memset, memchr, strchr, atoi, strstr) and `kfmt.cyr` (fmt_int_buf, fmt_hex_buf, kfmt_int, kfmt_hex, kfmt_hex0x, kfmt_byte)
- `cyrius.toml` project metadata
- `.cyrius-toolchain` version pinning (3.9.8)
- Kernel test suite: 106 assertions across 7 categories (PMM, heap, VFS, proc, syscall, kstdlib, initrd)
- `scripts/ktest.sh` — automated QEMU test runner with `-D TEST` gating
- Shell `test` command (gated behind `#ifdef TEST`, excluded from production binary)
- PCI device IDs displayed in hex (`lspci` shows `vendor=0x1af4` instead of decimal)
- `kernel/lib/` directory for vendored kernel-safe stdlib modules
- CI: format check (cyrfmt), security scan, dedicated build/test/docs jobs (4→7 jobs)
- Release: changelog extraction, source tarball, VERSION+cyrius.toml+tag consistency check

### Changed
- All scripts use `~/.cyrius/bin/` toolchain only (no `../cyrius/` fallback)
- Toolchain references updated: `cyrb`→`cyrius`, `cc2`→`cc3` across all scripts and docs
- CI/release workflows read toolchain version from `.cyrius-toolchain` (no hardcoded env)
- CI installs from GitHub release tarball directly (removed `ci-cyrius.sh` dependency)
- `version-bump.sh` rewritten: updates 9 files atomically with auto-computed `serial_println` byte lengths
- `kprint_num()` delegates to `kfmt_int()` (stdlib fmt)
- All byte-by-byte copy/compare/zero loops replaced with `memcpy()`/`memset()`/`memeq()` across initrd, shell, net, elf, fatfs, pmm, heap, proc, vfs, devs
- Shell `blkread` hexdump uses `kfmt_byte()`, `lspci` uses `kfmt_hex0x()`

### Fixed (P-1 Hardening — 14 buffer overflows)
- `proc_table[336]` → `[2688]` (16 procs x 168B, was 2-proc overflow)
- `proc_signals[16]`/`proc_sigmask[16]` → `[128]` (16 procs x 8B)
- `idt[512]` → `[4096]` (256 vectors x 16B, was overflowing by 3584 bytes)
- `gdt[8]` → `[56]`, `tss[16]` → `[104]` (x86_64 descriptor tables)
- `kb_isr[64]` → `[96]` (83-byte ISR machine code)
- `sc_normal[16]`/`sc_shifted[16]` → `[128]` (128-entry scancode tables)

- `sh_buf[16]` → `[128]` (shell input, was accepting 126 chars into 16 bytes)
- `tcp_conns[80]` → `[640]` (8 connections x 80B)
- `vfs_create_pipe()` memory leak on fd alloc failure
- `proc_create_address_space()` allocation rollback on pmm failure
- Signal number bounds checks in `kill` syscall and `proc_send_signal`
- Epoll watch list capacity check (max 8 watches in 128-byte buffer)

## [1.1.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added

#### Multi-Architecture Support
- Split monolithic `kernel/agnos.cyr` into 33 files: `arch/x86_64/` (14), `core/` (15), `user/` (3), main orchestrator
- aarch64 port: PL011 UART serial, GIC interrupt controller, ARM generic timer, keyboard via UART RX, paging stubs
- aarch64 boots to PMM+heap initialization on `qemu-system-aarch64 -M virt`
- Build with `sh scripts/build.sh --aarch64` using `-D ARCH_AARCH64`
- `arch_wait()` / `arch_halt()` abstraction — shared code is asm-free

#### Kybernet Integration
- 17 new syscalls (total 25): dup, mkdir, rmdir, mount, sync, reboot, pause, getuid, kill, sigprocmask, signalfd, epoll_create, epoll_ctl, epoll_wait, timerfd_create, timerfd_settime, umount
- Signal infrastructure: per-process `proc_signals[]` and `proc_sigmask[]`
- VFS types: signalfd (type 3), epoll (type 4), timerfd (type 5)
- agnosys dual backend: kybernet compiles with `-D LINUX` or `-D AGNOS`
- Bridge spec: `docs/development/kybernet-bridge.md` and `docs/development/syscall-additions.md`

#### Benchmarks and CI
- `rdtsc()` cycle-accurate benchmarks: PMM 1304 cy/op, syscall 188 cy/op, heap 1207 cy/op
- `scripts/bench.sh` — automated benchmark runner with `BENCHMARKS.md` and `bench-history.csv`
- `scripts/check.sh` — 11-point project validation (build, tests, docs, version consistency)
- `scripts/version-bump.sh` — automated version management
- CI uses Cyrius installer (`install.sh`) as single source of truth
- SHA256 checksums in release workflow

#### Optimizations
- PMM `next_free` hint: O(1) sequential allocation
- PMM init: 64-byte memset instead of 512 `pmm_set()` calls
- `kmalloc` zeros only requested size, not full slab block
- Dead code removed: `apic_send_ipi()`, unused `kfree()`

### Changed
- CI pinned to Cyrius 1.7.1 (was 1.6.1)
- `test.sh` requires `cyrb` (no `cc2` fallback for multi-file builds)
- aarch64 build no longer needs SP patch trampoline (compiler fixed in Cyrius 1.7.0)

### Fixed
- Port I/O helpers (`inb`/`outb`) had wrong rbp offsets from extra `var p = port` copies
- `slab_grow()` flags `0x03` → `0x83` (correct 2MB page flag)
- Global variable initializers not persisting in kernel mode — explicit init at boot

## [1.0.0] — 2026-04-05

- Syscalls: exit(0), write(1), getpid(2), spawn(3), waitpid(4), read(5), close(6), open(7)

#### Filesystem and Drivers
- ELF loader: static ELF64, per-process address space
- VFS: file table, device/memfile types
- Device drivers: serial char device
- Initrd: flat format, name lookup

#### Networking
- PCI bus: config space scan, device discovery

- ISR full register save (9 caller-saved regs instead of 3)
- Syscall write: length clamped to 4096, null pointer rejected
- Process state validation in syscall handlers

### Metrics
- Binary: 106KB (x86_64)
- Source: ~2,980 lines, 122 functions (single file)
